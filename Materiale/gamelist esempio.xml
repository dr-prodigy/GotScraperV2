    <desc>In FireFox, you pilot the fastest, most sophisticated plane on the face of the earth that has just been stolen from Russia. You fly through different areas shooting enemy MIGS and other FireFox prototypes. You must avoid Russian infra-red radar tracking and find the refueling points to make it further into the game. High altitude flying would use less fuel but would make FireFox more vulnerable to detection. Flying at a low altitude would use more fuel but would give you better cover from the MIGS.</desc>

    <desc>GP World was produced by Sega in 1984. In this laserdisc racing game, you have the choice between one of the three circuits proposed to compete with computer-controlled racing cars.
It is a rather average game in the realization where it is difficult to feel the feeling of speed despite the projection of the real circuits filmed as scenery.
But it is moving away from the traditional laserdisc spirit, interactive cartoons and shoot'em up, which changes a bit.</desc>
