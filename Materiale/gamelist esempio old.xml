FOR ANOTHER, MOVING TV CAMERAS ROAM AROUND IN SOME ROOMS, AND IF BASILDON COMES INTO CONTACT WITH ANY OF THESE, HE RETURNS TO THE COMPUTER ROOM AND TEN MINUTES OF HIS TIME IS LOST. 

HOWEVER, TO DEAL WITH THE CAMERAS, BASILDON IS EQUIPPED WITH TEN COOPERBLASTERS WHICH CAN BE USED TO SUMMON COOPERMAN. ONCE COOPERMAN HAS BEEN SUMMONED, THE PLAYER IS FREE TO NAVIGATE HIM TOWARD THE CAMERA, AND ONCE COOPERMAN COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THE CAMERA, IT IS DESTROYED. IF THE PLAYER LEAVES AND RE-ENTERS THE ROOM, THE CAMERAS RETURN AND THE PLAYER HAS TO SUMMON COOPERMAN AGAIN, WASTING PRECIOUS COOPERBLASTER AMMO. COOPERMAN CAN ONLY BE SUMMONED TEN TIMES, AND THE PLAYER IS UNABLE TO COLLECT MORE AMMO, SO THEY NEED TO USE COOPERMAN WISELY.

ONE SUMMON OUT OF TEN INTRODUCES THE PLAYER TO ANOTHER CHARACTER KNOWN AS BLUNDERWOMAN, WHO DOES FAR MORE DAMAGE THAN COOPERMAN BECAUSE WHEREAS COOPERMAN JUST FLIES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN TO THE OTHER IN A STRAIGHT LINE UNLESS THE PLAYER INTERFERES, BLUNDERWOMAN FLIES DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE SCREEN AND BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE PLAYER'S INVOLVEMENT, KILLING ANY CAMERAS THAT SHE DOES NOT KILL THE FIRST TIME.

THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE FIVE HOURS ARE OVER.</desc>

	<name>AFTERBURNER - US VERSION</name>
	<desc>AFTERBURNER IS A CONVERSION OF THE ARCADE GAME OF THE SAME NAME. THE GOAL IS SIMPLE: USE YOUR F-14 TOMCAT AND SHOOT AS MANY ENEMIES AS YOU CAN. THIS AIRCRAFT HAS TWO WEAPONS: LOCK-ON MISSILES AND VULCAN CANNONS (BASICALLY MACHINE GUNS). IN SOME VERSIONS THERE IS AN OPTION TO LET THE CANNONS SHOOT AUTOMATICALLY ALL THE TIME.

THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM BEHIND THE PLANE WITH YOU FIGHTING WAVE AFTER WAVE OF ENEMY FIGHTERS. BUT AT HEART IT OFFERS THE USUAL SHOOTER MECHANICS, MEANING YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME DODGING AND SHOOTING. SOMETIMES YOU COME ACROSS A FRIENDLY SUPPLY PLANE AND IF YOU DOCK WITH IT YOU CAN REPLENISH YOUR MISSILES.</desc>

	<name>AIRBORNE RANGER</name>
	<desc>IN THIS ACTION/SIMULATION GAME BY MICROPROSE THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF AN U.S. ARMY AIRBORNE RANGER. THESE AIRBORNE RANGERS ARE DROPPED BEHIND ENEMY LINES BY PARACHUTE TO PERFORM ALL KINDS OF DANGEROUS MISSIONS. GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF 3 PHASES:
READING THE MISSION BRIEFING AND OUTFITTING 3 SUPPLY PODS WITH MACHINE GUN AMMO, TIME BOMBS, FIRST-AID KITS, GRENADES &amp; LAW ROCKETS DEPENDING ON THIS BRIEFING.
2. FLYING OVER THE MISSION MAP IN A V-22 OSPREY PLANE TO DROP YOUR 3 SUPPLY PODS AND PARACHUTING OUT OF THE PLANE YOURSELF.
3. PERFORMING THE ACTUAL MISSIONS AND REACHING THE PICK-UP POINT BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT. THERE ARE 12 DIFFERENT MISSIONS WHICH INCLUDE CAPTURING AN ENEMY OFFICER, BLOWING UP AN AMMUNITION DEPOT, PHOTOGRAPHING AN EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT AND LIBERATING P.O.W.'S

MISSIONS TAKE PLACE IN EITHER AN ARCTIC, DESERT OR TEMPERATE SETTING. USING THE MISSION MAP THE PLAYER MUST DECIDE THE ROUTE TOWARDS THE MISSION OBJECTIVE. THIS MIGHT REQUIRE THEM TO CRAWL THROUGH TRENCHES, RUN AROUND MINEFIELDS OR TAKE OUT ENEMY SOLDIERS AND BUNKERS. AIRBORNE RANGER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES WITH SOME MISSIONS THAT REQUIRED A STEALTHY APPROACH (STAYING UNDETECTED UNTIL A CERTAIN TIME, TAKING OUT A GUARD AND STEALING AN ENEMY UNIFORM ETC.).

AIRBORNE RANGER CAN BE PLAYED IN PRACTICE OR VETERAN MODE. IN PRACTICE MODE, GAMEPLAY IS LIMITED TO A SINGLE MISSION, WHILE IN VETERAN MODE, A SERIES OF MISSIONS OR AN ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS PLAYED IN ORDER TO EARN MEDALS &amp; PROMOTIONS. ALL MISSIONS CAN BE PLAYED ON SEVERAL DIFFICULTY LEVELS.</desc>

	<name>ALIEN STORM</name>
	<desc>THE ALIENS ARE INVADING EARTH, AND IT'S UP TO THE "ALIEN BUSTERS" TO WIPE THEM OUT AND DESTROY THEIR CREATOR. THE BUSTERS CONSIST OF KARLA, GORDON, AND SCOOTER. EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN WEAPONS AND SPECIAL ATTACKS.

WHEN YOU START THE GAME, YOU CAN SELECT ANY ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AS. THERE ARE SIX MISSIONS TO COMPLETE (EIGHT IN THE GENESIS VERSION) WITH SEVERAL STAGES, AND EACH MISSION HAS YOU BLASTING ALIENS ALL THE WAY TO THE END, FROM THE STREETS TO THE MOTHER SHIP WHERE YOU'LL MEET THE MOTHER OF ALL ALIENS. UNFORTUNATELY, BLASTING THESE ALIENS WILL NOT BE AN EASY TASK, AS THEY GET TOUGHER IN EVERY MISSION, AND ARE CAPABLE OF HIDING INTO OBJECTS SUCH AS PLANTS, POSTBOXES, TRASHCANS, DRUMS, AND SEVERAL OTHERS. EACH MISSION HAS AN OBJECTIVE SUCH AS RESCUING PEOPLE DESTROYING AN UFO.

WHEN YOU DEAL WITH A FEW ALIENS, FLYING HEADS WILL APPEAR, WHICH YOU CAN SHOOT TO COLLECT LIFE OR ENERGY (BY THE WAY, LIFE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, SINCE IF YOURS GET EMPTY, YOU'RE DEAD). HOWEVER, RATHER THAN USING YOUR ORDINARY WEAPONS, YOU CAN USE THE SPECIAL ATTACKS THAT ARE ENOUGH TO KILL ALIENS YOU CURRENTLY SEE. THESE TYPES OF ATTACK VARY DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTER YOU CHOOSE AT THE START OF THE GAME. FOR INSTANCE, GORDON SUMMONS A U.S. AIR FORCE JET THAT DROP BOMBS ACROSS THE STREET, WHILE SCOOTER IS ABLE TO TELEPORT OUT OF HIS PRESENT LOCATION, AND LEAVE A SERIES OF BOMBS THAT WILL BLOW UP ALIENS ON SIGHT, HE WILL THEN RE-APPEAR. HOWEVER, USING YOUR CHARACTER'S SPECIAL ATTACK USES UP A LOT OF ENERGY, AND IF YOU HAVE LITTLE OR NO ENERGY, YOU CAN'T USE IT.

AT THE END OF SOME MISSIONS IS AN ALIEN BOSS, WHICH YOU MUST DESTROY IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE MISSION. ALSO, AT THE END OF EVERY ONE, YOU HAVE TO ENTER BUILDINGS WHERE YOU PARTICIPATE IN A SHOOTING GALLERY. THE OBJECT IS TO KILL ALIENS POPPING UP FROM SEVERAL LOCATIONS WITH THE BUILDING. 

YOU CAN PLAY ALIEN STORM BY YOURSELF, OR WITH ANOTHER PERSON.</desc>

YOU MUST TRAVEL TO THE OVERRUN PLANET OF SENTINEL 4, AND DESTROY THE WEAPONS CACHES THE REBELS HAVE BUILD UP. THEY CAN'T BE BLASTED WHEN YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM, ENSURING THAT A DEGREE OF PLANNING AND STRATEGY IS REQUIRED.

VIEWED FROM ABOVE IN LEVELS WITH SIMPLE SIDEWAYS SCROLLING, THE OBJECTIVE ON EACH LEVEL IS TO SHOOT EACH OF THE WEAPONS CRATES, BEFORE GOING THROUGH THE NEWLY-OPENED EXIT.  GUARD DROIDS MUST BE AVOIDED, BUT SHOOTING THEM CAN LEAVE THEM INACTIVE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEY CAN NOW BE SHOT OR HIT TO PUSH THEM IN THAT DIRECTION, WHICH CAN BE USED STRATEGICALLY TO MAKE MORE PATHS AVAILABLE. THERE IS A 2-MINUTE TIME LIMIT ON EACH LEVEL. EVERY 5TH LEVEL HAS A NUCLEAR WEAPON GUARDED BY A SEEKING ENEMY DROID, WHICH CONTINUALLY FOLLOWS YOU.</desc>

	<desc>THE ORIGINAL BREAKOUT CONCEPT INVOLVES CONTROLLING A BAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND USING IT TO CATCH AND DIRECT A BALL SO AS TO HIT ALL THE BRICKS WHICH ARE ARRANGED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. IT WAS UNPOPULAR FOR OVER A DECADE, BEFORE TAITO REVIVED IT WITH SOME NEW IDEAS IN THIS ARCADE GAME.

THE GAME'S PLOT REDEFINES THE BAT AS A VAUS SPACESHIP, THE BALL AS AN ENERGY BOLT, AND THE BRICKS FORM A MYSTERIOUS WALL STOPPING THE SHIP FROM PROGRESSING TO SAFETY.

BY THE MID-80S, POWER-UPS WERE POPULAR IN MOST TYPES OF ARCADE GAMES, AND ARKANOID FEATURES THEM. THEY ARE CAUGHT BY POSITIONING THE BAT BELOW THEM AS THEY FALL (MEANING THAT YOU RISK MISSING THE BALL IF YOU GO FOR THEM AT THE WRONG TIME). THE POWER-UPS INCLUDE LASERS (WHICH ARE MOUNTED TO EACH SIDE OF THE SHIP AND ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT OUT THE BLOCKS), A CATCHING DEVICE (SO AS TO BE ABLE TO FIRE THE BALL OFF AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE EVERY TIME YOU HIT IT) AND ONE THAT SLOWS THE BALL.... SORRY, BOLT.... DOWN. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE GAME INSPIRED TONNES OF CLONES, FEW OF WHICH ADDED ANYTHING ELSE.</desc>

THE PLAYER TAKES CONTROL OF TEENAGER MARTY MCFLY; ZAPPED INTO THE PAST BY AN EXPERIMENT GONE WRONG. TO PRESERVE MARTY'S FUTURE EXISTENCE, THE PLAYER MUST LURE MARTY'S MOTHER-TO-BE INTO SPENDING MORE TIME WITH HIS FATHER, WHILE AVOIDING THE SCHOOL BULLY. THESE COMPUTER-CONTROLLED CHARACTERS WILL WANDER THE GAME AREAS AND INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO BASIC RULES - MARTY'S MOTHER WILL FOLLOW HIM AROUND, HIS FATHER WILL AVOID THE BULLY, THE BULLY WILL KNOCK MARTY OUT IF THEIR PATHS SHOULD CROSS, ETC.  IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, MARTY'S PARENTS WILL NOT MEET AND HIS TIME WILL RUN OUT (INDICATED BY A FADING FAMILY PHOTO).  

THE GAME WORLD CONSISTS OF FIVE DISTINCT AREAS, EACH THE SIZE OF ONE SCREEN. A SEPARATE &amp;QUOT;HUB&amp;QUOT; AREA SCROLLS PAST THE ENTRANCES TO THESE FIVE ZONES. EACH OF THE FIVE AREAS HOLDS A COLLECTABLE ITEM, WITH A DIFFERENT EFFECT (ATTRACT, REPEL, OR NO EFFECT) ON EACH CHARACTER. A SKATEBOARD CAN ALSO BE COLLECTED TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE HUB FASTER.

THE PLAYER MUST USE THEIR COLLECTED ITEMS TO KEEP MARTY'S MOTHER AND FATHER IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, WHILE ALSO KEEPING THE BULLY AWAY.</desc>

	<desc>BACK TO THE FUTURE II IS A COLLECTION OF FIVE ARCADE AND PUZZLE GAMES.

BASED ON THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THE POPULAR HOLLYWOOD SERIES BACK TO THE FUTURE, THIS MOVIE CONVERSION HAS MARTY MCFLY AND DOC BROWN TRAVEL THROUGH TIME TO STOP THEIR ARCH-RIVAL BIFF FROM CHANGING THE FUTURE. THE GAME CONSISTS OF FIVE PARTS, EACH INSPIRED BY ONE OF THE MOVIE'S MOST MEMORABLE SCENES:

1. HOVERBOARD CHASE: A PAPERBOY CLONE WITHOUT NEWSPAPERS, BUT WITH ISOMETRIC LEVELS AND LOTS OF ENEMIES TO DODGE.
2. JENNIFER RESCUE: GUIDE MARTY'S GIRLFRIEND JENNIFER OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT HER MEETING ONE OF THE FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. OPEN AND CLOSE DOORS TO MAKE THE PERSONS GO FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT IN THIS TOP-DOWN PUZZLE SEQUENCE.
3. BEAT BIFF: A SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP SEQUENCE IN THE TRADITION OF DOUBLE DRAGON. FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH A GRIM 1985 BY JUMPING, HITTING AND KICKING AT BIFF'S LACKEYS.
4. BAND PUZZLE: REARRANGE THE MIXED-UP PARTS OF AN ANIMATED PICTURE OF THE SCHOOL BAND IN THIS SLIDING BLOCK PUZZLE. THE CLOCK IS TICKING.
5. HOVERBOARD CHASE 2: ANOTHER HOVERBOARD SEQUENCE, SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE, ONLY THIS TIME SET IN 1955.</desc>

1. BUCKBOARD CHASE: DOC BROWN GOES HORSEBACK IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE HILL VALLEY'S LOVELY SCHOOL TEACHER CLARA. THIS GAME OF QUICK DUCKING, JUMPING AND SHOOTING ALTERNATES BETWEEN A SIDE-SCROLLING AND A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE.

2. SHOOTING GALLERY: THE NAME SAYS IT ALL. A CLASSIC GAME OF AIM-AND-SHOOT, SPICED UP BY HIDDEN EXTRAS AND BONUS TARGETS.

3. PIE THROWING: MEET THE MAD DOG GANG. THEY HAVE GUNS, AND YOU HAVE... CREAM PIES. IT'S AN ISOMETRIC VERSION OF THE SHOOTING GALLERY, ONLY WITH AMMO. AND THE TARGETS SHOOT BACK.

4. THE TRAIN: BASICALLY A SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT-EM-UP ON TRAIN WAGONS WITH SOME DUCKING AND JUMPING. GET RID OF THE MECHANICS AND COLLECT SPEED LOGS TO PUSH THE ENGINE TO A MAGIC 88 MPH.</desc>

THESE ARE LOCATED AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE PLAYING AREA, SO YOU CAN PURSUE THEM IN EITHER ORDER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TERRORISTS HAVE PLENTY OF FORCES OUT TO PREVENT YOU GETTING TOO FAR.

UNUSUALLY, THE GAME FEATURES BOTH A HELICOPTER AND A TANK - YOU CHOOSE EITHER FROM THE BASE, AND CAN FLY/DRIVE BACK THERE TO CHANGE. THE BEST STRATEGY IS TO USE THE HELICOPTER TO SHOOT OUT AIR-BASED ENEMIES AND REPAIR THE VARIOUS BRIDGES, THEN RETURN FOR THE TANK. YOU GET 4000 SECONDS IN WHICH TO COMPLETE ALL THIS, AND LOSING A LIFE COSTS YOU 500 OF THESE.</desc>

YOU PLAY AS 3 CHARACTERS, ONE AT A TIME, IN THIS ACTION PLATFORMER: 

- JACK BURTON, A BURLY BUT BIT DUMB ACTION HERO WHO FIGHTS WITH FISTS AND LATER WITH A "BUSHMASTER" GUN.  AMMO MUST BE FOUND TO BE ABLE TO KEEP USING IT.

- WANG CHI, WHOSE GIRLFRIEND ALONG WITH JACK'S HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED, USES MARTIAL ARTS AND LATER A SWORD WHEN FOUND.  MORE SWORDS WILL BE NEEDED AS THEY WILL BREAK AFTER AWHILE.

- EGG SHEN IS A MAGICIAN WHO HAS VOWED TO STOP THE ANCIENT PROPHECY FROM COMING ABOUT, AND FIGHTS WITH MAGIC BOLTS WHICH CAN TURN LATER ON INTO MORE POWERFUL LIGHTNING IF MAGIC POTIONS ARE FOUND.  

EACH CHARACTER HAS AN ENERGY STATUS BAR AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN REPRESENTED BY A YIN AND YANG SYMBOL THAT SLOWLY DISAPPEARS BUT CAN BE REPLENISHED BY FINDING FOOD.  A WEAPONS SYMBOL IS SHOWN IF THEY POSSESS IT AND MAGIC POTION SYMBOL WILL GIVE THEM EXTRA STRENGTH IF FOUND.  YOU MUST ALTERNATE AMONG THE 3 CHARACTERS TO KEEP THEIR STATUS FROM FALLING TOO LOW AND DYING, AND EACH HAS TO PICK UP THEIR OWN APPROPRIATE WEAPONS.  THEY ALL CAN MOVE FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS, JUMP, DUCK AND ATTACK AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS.

THEY HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH SEVERAL LEVELS INCLUDING THE STREETS OF CHINATOWN, WHERE MARTIAL ARTIST ENEMIES AWAIT AND GUNMEN THAT MUST BE AVOIDED UNTIL MORE EXPERIENCE IS GATHERED. FURTHER ON, YOU GO INTO THE SEWERS WHERE ADDITIONAL MONSTERS MUST BE AVOIDED BY JUMPING OVER THEM.  THEN THEY WILL REACH THE ROOMS OF THE UNDERGROUND LAIR OF LO PAN WHERE LARGE-HAT WEARING ELEMENTALS CALLED STORMS AWAIT.  THE FINAL BATTLE TAKES PLACE IN THE MARRIAGE CHAMBER WHERE ARMOURED WARRIORS AND THE LEVITATING LO PAN MUST BE VANQUISHED IN ORDER TO FREE THE KIDNAPPED GIRLS.</desc>

	<desc>WE JOHNS TALES OF A BRAVE WORLD WAR 1 PILOT WERE UPDATED FOR A 1980S FEATURE FILM, WITH A PLOT INVOLVING JIM, BIGGLES BROTHER WHO LIVES IN THAT ERA. JIM TRAVELS BACK THROUGH TIME TO WARN BIGGLES OF A SPECTACULAR WEAPON THE GERMANS HAVE CREATED, WITH THE INTENTION OF CHANGING HISTORY  FOR THE WORSE.

THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO TWO SEPARATE GAMES, AND THE FIRST OF THESE IS ITSELF SPLIT INTO THREE SUB-GAMES. THE FIRST OF THESE IS A SIDE-VIEW FLIGHT GAME, IN WHICH YOU MUST SHOOT DOWN AND DODGE FOKKERS WHO COME AT YOU FROM THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN IN YOUR RICKETY PLANE, WITH A MACHINE GUN AND BOMBS ON BOARD. PART TWO IS SET IN MODERN-DAY LONDON, AND THE CHARACTERS MUST JUMP ACROSS A NETWORK OF ROOFS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A SECRET CODE. THERE ARE GUARDS TO AVOID, AND BIG GAPS BETWEEN ROOFS TO AVOID. THE THIRD PART IS A SIDE-VIEW GAME INSPIRED BY GREEN BERET, WITH A GUN TO FIRE AT ENCROACHING ENEMIES, GAMEPLAY ON MULTIPLE VERTICAL LEVELS, AND GRENADES TO COLLECT. LOSE A LIFE IN ANY OF THESE AND YOU WILL CYCLE BACK THROUGH THEM.

THE SECOND GAME IS A MORE SERIOUS FLIGHT SIMULATION HOWEVER. A HELICOPTER IS BEAMED BACK IN TIME FOR OUR INTREPID HERO TO USE. YOU MUST FIRST GO TO THE ALLIED CAMP TO GET THE SECRET WEAPONS LOCATION (AND YOU WILL NEED THE PASSWORD FROM PART ONE OF THE GAME FOR THIS), AND THEN HEAD TO THAT LOCATION TO DESTROY IT AND SAVE THE WORLD.</desc>

	<desc>THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS OLD FASHIONED NO FRILLS SHOOT 'EM UP IS A RAMBO DOPPELGANGER, WHICH THE DEVELOPERS MAY HAVE BEEN LUCKY NOT TO BE SUED OVER. THE MAIN PLAYER IS SURROUNDED BY A LARGE TANK WHICH MOVES AROUND AS IF YOU ARE WALKING IT FLINTSTONES STYLE.

GAMEPLAY FOLLOWS THE USUAL PATTERN FOR IKARI WARRIORS-STYLE GAMES - KILL OFF THE BAZOOKA-TOTING BADDIES, WHICH EMERGE FROM HIDING PLACES OR ENTER THE SCREEN IN WAVES. YOU CAN DO THIS BY EITHER SHOOTING THEM OR RUNNING THEM OVER WITH YOUR TANK. PARTS OF THE SCENERY OFTEN BLOCK YOUR PATH AND NEED DESTROYING. ONCE YOU CLEAR THE LEVEL YOU ARE CONFRONTED BY A BOSS, WHICH IN THE FIRST LEVEL IS AN ENORMOUS TANK WHICH YOU HAVE TO DISABLE THE GUNS OF.</desc>

	<path>./Blue Max (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>BLUE MAX</name>
	<desc>FOR THOSE WHO KNOW NOTHING OF WORLD WAR I OR IT'S HEROES, THIS GAME IS NAMED AFTER MAX CHATSWORTH, ONE OF BRITAIN'S FLYING ACES.  CHATSWORTH'S FAME BEGAN IN BATTLE, WHEN HE WAS OUT ON A RECONNAISSANCE MISSION, AND HIS SQUADRON WAS DECIMATED BY ENEMY PLANES.  THE PILOT SURVIVED, AND IN THE PROCESS SHOT DOWN SEVEN ENEMY FIGHTERS.  HE SHOT DOWN THIRTEEN MORE THE NEXT MONTH.  FOR THESE ACTIONS, GERMANY OFFERED THEIR BLUE MAX MEDAL TO ANYONE WHO COULD SHOOT CHATSWORTH DOWNAND CHATSWORTH GOT A NEW NICKNAMEBLUE MAX.

AS BLUE MAX, YOU GO OUT ON SORTIESFLYING MISSIONSATTACKING ASSIGNED TARGETS.  TARGETS INCLUDE BRIDGES, BUILDINGS, ENEMY PLANES, TANKS, BRIDGES, ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERIES, VEHICLES AND SHIPS.  YOU PROGRESS TO NEW MISSIONS AS YOU TAKE OUT YOUR TARGETS.

YOU MUST DROP BOMBS TO TAKE OUT THE GROUND TARGETS, AND THIS ACTION ALSO REPRESENTS A KEY DANGER FOR YOU.  UNLIKE THE MODERN BOMBERS THAT DROP BOMBS ON TARGETS FAR BELOW, EARLY AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN SEMI-SUICIDAL BOMBING RUNS.  THE PILOTS STARTED AT HIGH ALTITUDE, THEN TIPPED THE PLANES NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARDS THEIR GROUND-BASED TARGET, AND PULLED UP BEFORE THEY HIT THE GROUND.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DIVE AND PULL UP PROCESS, THEY RELEASED THE BOMB.  THERE WERE PROBLEMS OF COORDINATION, FOUND IN THE GAME AS WELLIF YOU TIME IT WRONG, OR START TOO LOW, YOU WILL CRASH.

THIS GAME HAS AROUSED SOME CONTROVERSY TOO, WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED IT TO BE BANNED IN GERMANY.  IN THE COURSE OF YOUR MISSIONS, YOU END UP BOMBING HOUSES.</desc>

THERE'S A COMPUTER OPPONENT, BUT THE SCORING ISN'T AFFECTED BY WHETHER YOU BEAT HIM JUST SO LONG AS YOU QUALIFY. THERE IS A TWO-PLAYER MODE. A UNIQUE FEATURE AT THE TIME IS THE ACTION REPLAY, WHICH CAN BE VIEWED IN SLOW MOTION.</desc>

IN EACH ROUND, COLLECTING A NUMBER OF BOMBS RESULTS IN A BONUS COIN APPEARING, AND COLLECTING THIS COIN WILL MAKE THE PLAYER'S SCORE INCREASE 2 TO 4 TIMES. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE "POWER BALL" APPEARS, AND WHEN YOU COLLECT THIS, YOU CAN DEFEAT ENEMIES AND HAVE MORE TIME TO COLLECT ALL THE BOMBS. THERE IS ALSO THE "E" COIN, WHICH GIVES JACK ONE ADDITIONAL LIFE, BUT RARELY DOES THIS COIN APPEAR.

THE MORE YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES, AS ENEMIES TRAVEL MORE QUICKLY TO GET YOU.</desc>

THESE VARY BETWEEN OPEN AND SHUT - THE OPEN ONES OFFER MORE POINTS, AND AN EXTRA LIFE IS ON OFFER FOR COLLECTING 10 IN A ROW, SO IF POSSIBLE THE ROUTE SHOULD TAKE IN THE OPEN ONES IN ORDER.

GAMEPLAY DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL, IN THAT BOMBJACK'S MOVEMENT IS NO LONGER FREE AND SELF-PROPELLED. INSTEAD, HE MOVES FLICK-STYLE BETWEEN LEDGES, SO LONG AS ONE IS DIRECTLY WITHIN ONE OF THE 4 COMPASS DIRECTIONS. BADDIES CAN BE PUSHED OFF LEDGES, BUT THIS USES UP SOME OF JACK'S LIMITED ENERGY.</desc>

HOWEVER, LITTLE DO THEY KNOW THAT EACH BUILDING IS PACKED WITH SECURITY GUARDS WHO WILL RAISE THE ALARM IF THEY ARE CAUGHT RED-HANDED. FORTUNATELY BOTH MOBO AND ROBO ARE EQUIPPED WITH BULLETS THAT CAN KNOCK THE GUARDS UNCONSCIOUS FOR A FEW SECONDS. AN $100 REWARD WILL BE GIVEN OUT IF MOBO AND ROBO ARE APPREHENDED.

AS EITHER MOBO OR ROBO, YOU MUST COLLECT ALL THE TREASURES BEFORE LEAVING THE TEN BUILDINGS AND SHOOT ANY SECURITY GUARDS THAT GET IN YOUR WAY. REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE UNDER A TIME LIMIT. AN IN-GAME MAP WILL HELP YOU LOCATE THE TREASURES. THERE IS A BONUS STAGE AFTER THREE BUILDINGS, WHERE THE OBJECT IS TO COLLECT THE GOLD BARS IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITHOUT  ONE OF THE THREE SPOTLIGHTS SHINING ON YOU. IF IT IS POSSIBLE, HIDE BEHIND OPEN DOORS. IF YOU MANAGE TO GET ALL THE GOLD BARS, 10,000 POINTS IS ADDED TO YOUR SCORE. THERE ARE THREE OF THESE BONUS STAGES, BUT EACH OF THEM VARIES.</desc>

	<desc>THE LATE MARTIAL ARTS HERO FEATURES IN THIS PLATFORM GAME, WITH THE AIM OF REACHING A WIZARD IN AN UNDERGROUND LAIR, DEFEAT OF WHOM CAN OFFER HIM UNTOLD WEALTH. 

IN EACH AREA YOU MUST COLLECT THE MANY STRATEGICALLY-PLACED LANTERNS BEFORE EXITING THROUGH THE NEWLY-REVEALED PASSAGEWAY. SOME ROOMS ALSO HAVE ESCALATOR-TYPE SECTIONS TO RUN ALONG, AND THE STANDARD (ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY ILLOGICAL IN THIS CONTEXT) LADDERS. 

ON THE WAY, YOU'LL FIGHT TWO ENEMIES - A NINJA AND A GREEN SUMO WARRIOR NAMED YAMO. YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM BY PUNCHING, KICKING, DROPPING ON THEIR HEADS OR LURING THEM INTO HAZARDOUS TERRAIN, OR EVEN BY MAKING THEM ACCIDENTALLY HIT EACH OTHER. EVEN AFTER THEY ARE KILLED, HOWEVER, THEY KEEP COMING BACK FOR MORE AFTER A FEW SECONDS. SINCE THEY CAN MOVE PRETTY INTELLIGENTLY (THEY EVEN CLIMB LADDERS), YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR THEM. 

THERE ARE LOTS OF HAZARDS TO AVOID BY EITHER WALKING ROUND OR JUMPING - WALLS OF ELECTRICAL CHARGE AND EXPLODING BUSHES FOR EXAMPLE.</desc>

	<desc>A COMPUTER GAME VERSION OF A FAMED TV QUIZ SHOW BASED AROUND THE GAME OF DARTS. THE COMPUTER VERSION FEATURES 2 PLAYERS, BOTH HUMAN-CONTROLLED - ON TV THERE WERE 3 TEAMS OF 2 (ONE AMATEUR DARTS PLAYER AND ONE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS)

THE FIRST ROUND USES A CUSTOM BOARD WHICH IS SPLIT BOTH INWARDS (4 SEPARATE GRADES REPRESENTING 30,50,100 AND 200 POINTS RESPECTIVELY) AND AROUND (10 SECTIONS LETTERED A-K, REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT SUBJECT EACH). THE FIRST PLAYER MUST CHOOSE A CATEGORY TO AIM AT, AND SHOOT A DART AT IT. IF THEY HIT ONE OF THE SECTIONS FOR THAT LETTER, THEY GET THAT SCORE AND ARE ASKED THE QUESTION. IF THEY HIT ANOTHER CATEGORY THEY GET NO BONUS BUT ARE ASKED THAT QUESTION - IF IT'S STILL THERE. EACH PLAYERS GETS 3 GOES AT THIS, WITH INCREASINGLY TOUGH QUESTIONS WORTH 30,50,100 POINTS.

ROUND 2 INVOLVES EACH PLAYER THROWING 3 DARTS AT A STANDARD BOARD, WITH THE PLAYER WHO SCORES THE MOST GETTING ASKED A QUESTION, WITH THE VALUE OF THE DARTS ON OFFER. IF THEY GET IT WRONG, THE OTHER PLAYER GETS A CHANCE, FOR THE POINTS THEY SCORED. THIS IS REPEATED 3 TIMES.

AFTER THESE 2 ROUNDS, THE PLAYER WHO IS IN FRONT GETS TO AIM AT A BOARD WITH 8 BLACK SEGMENTS, 8 RED ONES AND THE BULLSEYE. THE BULLY SCORES 50 POINTS, THE OTHERS REDS SCORE A RANDOMLY-SELECTED VALUE BETWEEN 15 AND 45, THE BLACKS SCORE ZERO, AND HITTING A RED FOR THE SECOND TIME LOSES YOU THAT PRIZE - HENCE THE PRESENTER'S CATCHPHRASE "KEEP OUT OF THE BLACK AND INTO THE RED, NOTHING IN THIS GAME FOR 2 IN A BED".

ONCE THE PLAYER HAS FINISHED THE ROUND, THEY CHOOSE WHETHER TO GAMBLE THEIR SCORE AGAINST THE FINAL PRIZE BOARD. 101 POINTS MUST BE SCORED IN 4 DARTS (IN THE TV SHOW IT WAS 6 - 3 FOR EACH PLAYER)</desc>

	<name>BULLY'S SPORTING DARTS</name>
	<desc>DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY DARTS?  WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY DARTS ON YOUR COMPUTER?  HERE IS YOUR CHANCE.

THIS GAME OFFERS SEVEN SCORING STYLES SUCH AS GOLF, CRICKET, AND THE NORMAL 501 SCORING STYLE.  CHOOSE HOW YOU WANT TO SCORE THE GAME AND HOP RIGHT IN AND PLAY.  AIM YOUR DART WITH YOUR JOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD, THEN LET IT FLY AND HOPE YOU HIT SOMETHING GOOD!

THE GAME AUTOMATICALLY SCORES FOR YOU SO IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SCORE A DART GAME, YOU CAN STILL PLAY.  KNOWING WHAT YOU SHOULD AIM FOR IS HELPFUL FOR GETTING HIGH SCORES, HOWEVER.

THE DARTS GAMES INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE ARE:

1. 501
THIS IS THE CLASSIC DARTS GAME WHERE BOTH PLAYERS START WITH 501 POINTS. SCORES ARE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT EACH PLAYER SCORES WHEN IT'S THEIR TURN TO THROW. A LEG ENDS WHEN ONE PLAYER REDUCES THEIR SCORE TO ZERO BY HITTING A DOUBLE. A GAME IS THE BEST OF THREE LEGS.

ROUND THE CLOCK
THE PLAYER MUST HIT EACH NUMBER IN TURN, STARTING AT ONE AND ENDING WITH THE BULLSEYE. A GAME IS THE BEST OF THREE LEGS.

FOOTBALL
IN THIS TIMED GAME, THE NUMBER OF EACH SEGMENT PLAYS NO PART ON THIS GAME.
EACH PLAYER HAS A DESIGNATED 'GOAL' AREA. PLAYERS TAKE IT IN TURNS TO HIT A SEQUENCE OF BEDS PROGRESSING TOWARDS THE OPPONENTS GOAL. THE WINNER IS THE PLAYER WHO HAS SCORED THE MOST GOALS WHEN TIME IS UP.

TENNIS
THE PLAYER SERVING MUST HIT DOUBLES, THE PLAYER RECEIVING MUST HIT TREBLES.
A BED IS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE BOARD, THIS IS THE 'TENNIS BALL'. THE SERVER HAS TWO CHANCES TO HIT THEIR DESIGNATED BED TO 'SERVE' THE BALL. IF THEY ARE IN SUCCESSFUL THE POINT GOES TO THE RECEIVER. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL THE RECEIVER MUST HIT THEIR DESIGNATED TREBLE BED. THIS IS REPEATED UNTIL A PLAYER FAILS TO HIT THE BALL. SCORING IS AS IN TENNIS. A MATCH CONSISTS OF THE BEST OF THREE SETS.

GOLF
ONLY THE NUMBERS ONE TOP EIGHTEEN ARE USED IN THIS GAME, REPRESENTING THE EIGHTEEN HOLES ON THE GOLF COURSE.
THE OBJECT IS TO HIT EACH NUMBER THREE TIMES, HITTING A DOUBLE OR A TRIPLE COUNTS AS TWO OR THREE RESPECTIVELY, STARTING AT ONE AND WORKING THROUGH TO EIGHTEEN. THE WINNER IS THE PLAYER TO COMPLETE THE GAME WITH THE FEWEST DARTS

CRICKET
IN THIS GAME THE PLAYERS REPRESENT THE BATTING AND THE BOWLING SIDES AT CRICKET.
THE 'BOWLER' ATTEMPTS BOWL THE BATSMEN OUT BY HITTING THE INNER OR THE BULLSEYE, THE INNER TAKES OUT ONE BATSMAN, THE BULL TAKES OUT TWO.
MEANWHILE THE BATTING PLAYER ATTEMPTS TO SCORE AS HIGHLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT ONLY POINTS SCORED OVER FORTY COUNT.
THE TEAM WITH THE MOST RUNS AFTER TWO INNINGS ARE THE WINNERS.

SNOOKER
ALL NUMBERS COUNT IN THIS GAME, NUMBERS ONE TO FIFTEEN REPRESENT THE FIFTEEN RED BALLS ON THE SNOOKER TABLE, WHILE THE REMAINING NUMBERS REPRESENT THE COLORS, SIXTEEN BEING YELLOW AND SO ON THROUGH TO TWENTY BEING BLACK.
TO SCORE, OR POT A BALL, THAT BALL HAS TO BE HIT BY THE PLAYER IN SEQUENCE. THE RED BALLS MUST BE HIT ONCE AND THE COLORED BALLS FOUR TIMES (DOUBLES AND TREBLES COUNT AS TWO AND THREE HITS RESPECTIVELY.) PLAY FOLLOWS SNOOKER IN THAT AFTER A RED BALL IS POTTED A COLOR MUST BE ATTEMPTED, HITTING A BALL OUT OF SEQUENCE ENDS A TURN AND FORFEITS POINTS ETC. THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE WINS.</desc>

	<desc>CABAL IS A COIN-OP CONVERSION OF CAPCOM'S ARCADE GAME. THE MECHANICS OF THE GAME ARE SIMPLE: SHOOT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!

THE HERO (THERE IS A TWO PLAYER MODE) RUNS BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, DUCKING AND DODGING BULLETS AND GRENADES FROM THE ENEMY. THE ROLL MANEUVER FROM THE ARCADE WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE PC VERSION. YOU RETURN FIRE BY MOVING A TARGET AROUND THE SCREEN WHICH ALSO MOVES YOUR CHARACTER, SO BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN INTO A BULLET.

THE ENEMIES THROUGHOUT THE 5 LEVELS, COME THICK AND FAST AND THERE ARE LOADS OF THEM, NORMAL FOOT SOLDIERS, TANKS, HELICOPTERS AND END OF LEVEL BOSSES, LIKE SUBMARINES AND WAR MACHINES.

JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN CAN BE BLOWN UP OR SHOT. THERE ARE BONUS POINTS TO BE PICKED UP FOR DESTROYING BUILDINGS AND WEAPONS TO BE PICKED UP FROM THE ENEMY, SUCH AS MACHINE- AND SHOT-GUNS.</desc>

	<desc>INSANE GENIUS AUSTEN VAN FLYSWATTER HAS STOLEN A HUGE COLLECTION OF DIAMONDS, AND RETRIEVING THEM INVOLVES NAVIGATING A SUCCESSION OF FIENDISHLY-DESIGNED ARRANGEMENTS OF PLATFORMS AND TRAPS. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A JOB FOR A RETIRED SUPERHERO? CAPTAIN DYNAMO THINKS SO, AND AIMS TO RECAPTURE THEM FOR THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER.

GAMEPLAY IS PLATFORM-BASED, WITH 12 VERTICALLY-SCROLLING LEVELS, EACH CONTAINING AROUND 50 DIAMONDS - THE MORE OF THESE YOU CAN COLLECT, THE HIGHER YOUR SCORE. SOME WILL REQUIRE ADVANCE PLANNING TO REACH, WHILE YOU WILL OFTEN BE DEPENDENT ON BOOSTER PADS TO REACH THE HIGHER SECTIONS OF A LEVEL.</desc>

	<desc>CASTLE MASTER IS THE FOURTH AND FINAL INDIVIDUAL GAME TO USE THE FREESCAPE FIRST-PERSON SOLID 3D GAME SYSTEM (AFTER DRILLER, DARK SIDE AND TOTAL ECLIPSE). AS A PRINCE OR PRINCESS ARMED WITH A SLINGSHOT, YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE A MEDIEVAL CASTLE TO FREE YOUR BELOVED FROM THE EVIL MAGISTER. 

GAMEPLAY COMBINES ACTION AND PUZZLE-SOLVING, ACROSS FOUR PRIMARY TOWERS WITH THREE LEVELS EACH. DOORS MUST BE OPENED USING ONE OF THE TEN INCLUDED KEYS. THESE ARE UNMARKED, AS ARE THE VARIOUS POTIONS - MAKING IT A CHALLENGE TO KNOW WHICH KEYS OPEN WHICH DOORS, AND WHICH POTIONS ARE BENEFICIAL. 

CONTACT WITH GHOULS DRAINS YOUR ENERGY, AS DOES FALLING TOO FAR (THERE ARE NARROW PATHWAYS TO NEGOTIATE), WHILE EATING CHEESE CAN REPLENISH THIS. MOVEMENT AND AIMING ARE CONTROLLED SEPARATELY.</desc>

THE OVERGROUND SECTIONS PLAY LIKE STANDARD SHOOT 'EM UPS, AS YOUR BROOM IS NOT AFFECTED BY GRAVITY AND CAN FIRE BULLETS USING YOUR MAGIC ENERGY.

ONCE YOU GO UNDERGROUND, THE GAMEPLAY BECOMES A TEST OF PRECISION PLATFORM JUMPING, INCLUDING SOME MANIC MINER-ESQUE BLIND JUMPS. THE SIX UNDERGROUND SECTIONS CAN BE COMPLETED IN A VARIETY OF ORDERS, BUT YOU WILL SOMETIMES REACH POINTS THAT CNA'T BE COMPLETED WITHOUT OBJECTS FROM OTHER SECTIONS, SO A LOT OF BACK-TRACKING IS REQUIRED.

	<desc>THIS IS A PUZZLE GAME WHERE YOU MUST EXPLODE ALL OF THE BOMBS ON EACH LEVEL, USING A SPARK.  THE SPARK FLOWS ALONG A FUSE, WHICH IS MADE UP OF A SERIES OF TILES.  THESE CAN BE MOVED, IN THE MANNER OF SLIDING PUZZLES, WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE GAP, AND TILES CAN BE MOVED INTO THE GAP, CREATING A NEW GAP.  THE AIM IS THEN TO MOVE THE TILES SO THE FUSE FORMS A PATH FROM THE SPARK TO EACH BOMB. 

THERE IS A TIME LIMIT, HOWEVER, AND EXTRA TIME IS KNOCKED OFF IF THE SPARK REACHES A DEAD END.  ALSO SOME LEVELS CONTAIN WATER DROPLETS, THAT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK IF THEY TOUCH IT.</desc>

THE FIRST RACE IS IN BRAZIL AND FEATURES 100 CARS, AND REQUIRES YOU TO FINISH IN THE TOP 80 IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR  NEXT RACE. AS YOU WORK THROUGH THE 8 RACES THE SIZE OF THE FIELD STEADILY DECREASES, BUT SO DOES THE WORST ACCEPTABLE FINISHING POSITION TO QUALIFY.

THE CAR HAS HIGH AND LOW GEARS, AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE FROM CONTACT WITH ANOTHER CAR. ONCE YOU HIT A CAR OR A PIECE OF THE TRACKSIDE SCENERY YOU WILL BE CALLED INTO THE PITS - FAIL TO MAKE IT BACK, OR HIT ANOTHER CAR, AND YOU WILL CRASH AND LOSE SEVERAL SECONDS.</desc>

THIS IS MADE A LITTLE EASIER BY THE FACT THAT YOUR TURBOCHARGED FERRARI F40 CAN DO OVER 300 MPH.

THERE ARE MANY FORKS IN THE ROAD, WITH ARROWS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN INDICATING WHICH ROUTE IS QUICKER. ANY HIGH-SPEED CONTACT CAUSES THE CAR TO BLOW UP, BUT YOU HAVE AN INFINITE SUPPLY OF THESE, AND THE ONLY REAL PENALTY IS THE LOST TIME. THERE ARE LOTS OF ROAD BLOCKS TO SWERVE AROUND. THE POLICE ARE AFTER YOU - PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIRENS AND STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY.</desc>

	<desc>IF YOU ARE TO BE HONORED WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE OSTAN RACE, YOU MUST EXPLORE A VIRTUAL REALITY WORLD, COLLECT THE 24 OBJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN HIDDEN WITHIN, AND BRING THEM ALL BACK TO THE BASE.

CYLU IS VIEWED ISOMETRICALLY, AND PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SOLVING PUZZLES ALONG THE LINES OF MANY ULTIMATE PLAY THE GAME TITLES. ONLY FIVE OBJECTS CAN BE CARRIED AT A TIME, WHICH MEANS THE ROUTE INVOLVES A LOT OF BACK-TRACKING. THIS IS SLIGHTLY LESSENED ONCE YOU FIND SOME OF THE TELEPORT BAYS, AND THE KEY TO OPERATE THEM.

THERE ARE 32 NUMBERED FORCEFIELDS AROUND THE GAME, AND THESE MUST BE DEACTIVATED BY FINDING THE APPROPRIATE SILICON CHIP. YOUR DROID REQUIRES REGULAR RE-FUELING, EITHER FROM CANISTERS LOCATED IN THE EARLY SECTIONS OF THE GAME, OR FROM THE RFL UNIT YOU CAN PICK UP LATER.</desc>

	<desc>ALTHOUGH DIRECTLY LICENSED TO JOHN PALEVICH'S EARLIEST INTERPRETATION OF TOP-VIEW DUNGEON-BASED SLASHING, THIS GAME'S FEATURES ARE CLOSEST TO GAUNTLET, THE COIN-OP IT INSPIRED. 

YOU PLAY EITHER SHEBA OR THOR (BOTH ARE ACTIVE IN A SIMULTANEOUS 2-PLAYER GAME) AS YOU MOVE THROUGH 15 DUNGEONS, WITH THE AIM OF COLLECTING ALL THE AVAILABLE TREASURE. IF THIS IS DONE SUCCESSFULLY, A CODE WILL BE GRANTED - PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE GAME. FOES ARE RELEASED IN SWARMS THROUGH A CONTROL BOX. ONCE ALL THESE ARE DEAD YOU MUST DESTROY THE BOX, TO PREVENT RESPAWNING.

THE DUNGEONS FEATURE TREASURE, FOOD (FOR ENERGY), AND SPELLS. BE CAREFUL NOT TO DESTROY THESE BY SHOOTING THEM. EACH SPELL HAS A RANDOM FUNCTION - DISORIENTATING, PARALYSING OR KILLING THE OPPONENTS ON SCREEN. LIKE GAUNTLET YOU ARE CONSTANTLY LOSING ENERGY, HOWEVER TREASURE CAN BE TRADED IN FOR ENERGY.</desc>

	<name>DAYS OF THUNDER</name>
	<desc>TOM CRUISE'S FILM BROUGHT NASCAR RACING TO THE MASSES, AND MINDSCAPE DID THE SAME FOR GAMES PLAYERS WITH THIS LICENSE. IF YOU MENTALLY CHANGE THE DRIVER NAMES, IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A RECREATION OF REAL NASCAR RACING RATHER THAN A DIRECT RECREATION OF THE FILM. 

YOU PLAY CRUISE'S COLE TRICKLE CHARACTER (HIS NAME, LIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS, IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO THAT OF A REAL NASCAR RACER OF THE DAY) AGAINST YOUR RIVALS ON 8 TRACKS, BASED ON REAL-LIFE COUNTERPARTS. THE RACES ARE ALL ON OVALS, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT LENGTHS, CORNER TYPES AND GRADIENTS ARE VARIED.  THIS MEANS THAT THE IDEAL RACING LINE ON ONE TRACK CAN PUT YOU INTO THE WALL ON ANOTHER. QUALIFYING IS INCORPORATED ALONGSIDE THE RACES THEMSELVES.

FROM TIMES TO TIMES YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL INTO THE PIT STOP AREA. WHEN DOING SO, YOU CONTROL THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE PIT CREW. LOOSING TIME ON PIT WILL MAKE YOU LOOSE POSITIONS AT THE RACE. THE OTHER RACERS, HOWEVER, NEVER PIT.

THE NES VERSION HAS 3RD-PERSON PERSPECTIVE ONLY.</desc>

	<desc>DEACTIVATORS IS AN ARCADE-PUZZLE MAZE GAME WHICH PUTS YOU IN CONTROL OF A SQUAD OF BOMB DISPOSAL DROIDS. YOU MUST PICK THEM UP AND QUICKLY THROW THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING TO SAFETY - FAILURE TO DO THIS COSTS YOU A DROID AND A ROOM (OCCASIONALLY BLOCKING OFF OTHER ESSENTIAL ROOMS). THE GAME'S LEVELS HAVE GRID-LIKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH DOORS, TRAPDOORS AND POLES, AND INCREASE IN SIZE AS THE GAME GOES ON. FOR BOTH THESE REASONS, MAPPING IS ESSENTIAL.

SECURITY DROIDS ARE ON PATROL, BUT THESE CAN BE TRICKED INTO FALLING DOWN HOLES. A COMPUTER ROOM IS THE HUB OF YOUR ACTIVITIES - THIS ALLOWS YOU TO USE TELEPORTS AND TURN OFF FORCE FIELDS, VIA THE APPROPRIATE CIRCUIT BOARDS WHICH ARE HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS. ON LATER LEVELS THE GRAVITY ISN'T CONSTANT AND YOU WILL FIND ROOMS WITH DISTORTED DIRECTIONAL SENSES, INCREASING THE PRECISION REQUIRED SIGNIFICANTLY.</desc>

INITIALLY YOU WILL FACE A FEW PLANES FLYING TOWARDS YOU. RED PLANES SHOOT AT YOU, AND LATER THERE ARE BLACK 'SUICIDE PLANES' WHICH AIM TO TAKE YOU DOWN KAMIKAZE STYLE, AND 'BLUE MAX' PLANES WHICH ARE EXTRA-TOUGH.

AFTER THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS ADDED, IN THE SHAPE OF HILLS TO FLY AROUND OR OVER. AFTER THIS, YOU REACH THE BOMBING ZONE, IN WHICH YOU GUIDE THE BOMBERS BEHIND YOU AND INSTRUCT THEM WHICH SITES TO BOMB.

THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM THE COCKPIT, WITH DISPLAYS TELLING YOU OF HOW MUCH DAMAGE YOU AND THE BOMBER HAVE TAKEN, AND WHETHER YOU ARE STEERING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. A MAP IS BUILD IN. THE CONTROLS CAN BE SET IN TWO WAYS, FOR 'UP' ON THE JOYSTICK EITHER EQUALING 'MOVE UPWARDS' OR 'DIVE' (AS ON A REAL PLANE).</desc>

	<desc>DIG DUG IS A 1-2 PLAYER ARCADE GAME IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR SHOVEL TO DIG YOUR WAY THROUGH THE EARTH. STOPPING YOU FROM DOING THIS ARE TWO MONSTERS, CALLED POOKA AND FYGAR, WHO WILL CONTINUALLY CHASE YOU AROUND. THE ONLY WEAPON THAT YOU CARRY IS AN AIR PUMP, WHICH YOU CAN USE TO INFLATE THE MONSTERS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY EXPLODE. (IF YOU START TO INFLATE THEM BUT STOP DOING SO, THE MONSTERS WILL GET TURNED BACK TO THEIR NORMAL SELVES.) FURTHERMORE, ROCKS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE EARTH, AND YOU CAN USE THESE ROCKS TO SQUASH THEM. IF THE MONSTERS DO NOT FIND YOU FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THEY WILL EVENTUALLY GET TURNED INTO GHOSTS, WHICH ARE ABLE TO WALK THROUGH THE EARTH. THEY ARE INVINCIBLE AND CANNOT BE KILLED. FROM TIME TO TIME, VEGETABLES WILL APPEAR IN THE CENTER, AND YOU CAN GET THESE FOR POINTS.</desc>

	<desc>THE GAME IS A PLATFORM ADVENTURE WHERE DIZZY MUST SEARCH THE FAIRY TALE LAND OF KATMANDU FOR A LEPRECHAUN'S WIG, A CLOUD'S SILVER LINING, A VAMPIRE DUX FEATHER, AND A TROLL BREW AND DEPOSIT THEM IN A CAULDRON TO MAKE A POTION TO DEFEAT THE EVIL WIZARD ZAKS. THE GAMEPLAY INVOLVES COLLECTING ITEMS AND MOVING TO OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE THE ITEM IS REQUIRED; FOR EXAMPLE, AT ONE POINT A RAINCOAT IS NEEDED TO PROTECT AGAINST DAMAGING RAIN. THIS IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE ONLY ONE ITEM CAN BE CARRIED AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

UNLIKE LATER GAMES IN THE SERIES, WHICH FOCUS MORE ON THE INVENTORY-BASED PUZZLES, THIS GAME FEATURES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF HAZARDS THAT KILL THE PLAYER ON CONTACT. WITH ONLY THREE LIVES INITIALLY TO COMPLETE THE GAME, THIS MAKES IT A VERY DIFFICULT GAME TO COMPLETE BY TODAY'S STANDARDS.</desc>

	<name>DONKEY KONG</name>
	<desc>RELEASED IN THE ARCADES IN 1981, DONKEY KONG WAS NOT ONLY NINTENDO'S FIRST REAL SMASH HIT FOR THE COMPANY, BUT MARKED THE INTRODUCTION FOR TWO OF THEIR MOST POPULAR MASCOTS: MARIO (ORIGINALLY "JUMPMAN") AND DONKEY KONG.

DONKEY KONG IS A PLATFORM-ACTION GAME THAT HAS MARIO SCALE FOUR DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL THEMED LEVELS (CONSTRUCTION ZONE, CEMENT FACTORY, AN ELEVATOR-THEMED LEVEL, AND REMOVING RIVETS FROM GIRDERS) IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS, PAULINE, FROM THE BIG APE BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT.  ONCE THE RIVETS ARE REMOVED FROM THE FINAL LEVEL, DONKEY KONG FALLS, AND THE TWO LOVERS ARE REUNITED.  FROM THERE, THE LEVELS START OVER AT A HIGHER DIFFICULTY.

ALONG THE WAY, MARIO MUST DODGE A CONSTANT STREAM OF BARRELS, "LIVING" FIREBALLS, AND SPRING-WEIGHTS.  ALTHOUGH NOT AS POWERFUL AS IN OTHER FUTURE GAMES, MARIO CAN FIND A HAMMER WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO DESTROY THE BARRELS AND FIREBALLS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.  ADDITIONALLY, MARIO CAN ALSO FIND PAULINE'S HAT, PURSE AND UMBRELLA FOR ADDITIONAL BONUS POINTS.

DONKEY KONG IS ALSO NOTABLE FOR BEING ONE OF THE FIRST COMPLETE NARRATIVES IN VIDEO GAME FORM, TOLD THROUGH SIMPLISTIC CUT SCENES THAT ADVANCE THE STORY.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT IN VERSIONS OF THE GAME FOR EARLY 1980'S CONSOLES, DONKEY KONG ONLY USED 2-3 OF THE ORIGINAL LEVELS, WITH THE CEMENT FACTORY USUALLY OMITTED.</desc>

THE THING WHICH SETS THE GAME APART FROM EVERY OTHER HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT EM UP (EXCEPT SAINT DRAGON) IS THAT YOU ARE RIDING ON THE BACK OF A DRAGON, CALLED BAHAMOOT. BOTH YOU AND THE DRAGON HAVE FIREPOWER, AND HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON INCREASES BAHAMOOTS ENERGY BOLTS FEROCITY. THE DRAGONS TAIL CAN BE CONTROLLED INDIRECTLY, AND BECAUSE IT IS INDESTRUCTIBLE, IT CAN BE USED EITHER AS A SHIELD, OR AS A WEAPON IN ITS OWN RIGHT. 

THERE ARE POWER-UPS TO COLLECT BY DISMOUNTING FROM THE DRAGON AND WALKING INTO THEM. THESE INCLUDE FIERY BREATH, BOLTS SHOT FROM BAHAMOOTS TAIL, HOMING MISSILES OF SORTS, AND LIGHTNING BOLTS, WITH ONLY ONE EVER ACTIVE AT A TIME. EACH LEVEL HAS A TIME LIMIT.</desc>

	<name>DROPZONE</name>
	<desc>DROPZONE WAS THE FIRST GAME TO PROPEL ARCHER MACLEAN TO STARDOM. THE GAME, ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR THE 8-BIT ATARIS, IS BASICALLY A DEFENDER CLONE, BUT POPULAR BECAUSE IT SO CLOSELY RECREATES THE GAMEPLAY OF THE ORIGINAL DEFENDER, WITH ITS SPEEDY SCROLLING AND FRANTIC GAMEPLAY.

THE PLAYER IS A SPACEMAN WITH A JET-PACK, FLYING ACROSS A BARREN LANDSCAPE WHOSE SKIES ARE INHABITED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ALIENS; FROM THE SIMPLE PLANTER TO THE SLOWLY ADVANCING BLUNDER STORM OR THE QUICK, AGGRESSIVE NEMESITE. 

PLANTERS AND NEMESITES WILL TRY TO PICKUP THE SMALL MEN WALKING ON THE SURFACE, WHO MUST THEN BE RESCUED. YOU MUST SHOOT DOWN THE ALIEN, WHILE AVOIDING TO HIT THE MAN. SOMETIMES, THE ALIENS WILL CARRY AN ANDROID, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE HUMAN BUT DEADLY. CARE MUST BE TAKEN SO AS TO NOT PICK UP THE ANDROIDS. ALL MEN MUST BE TRANSPORTED TO A SURFACE BASE, WHERE THEY ARE PUT IN SAFETY. THIS IS THE DROPZONE.</desc>

	<name>DRUID</name>
	<desc>DRUID IS AN ACTION GAME INSPIRED BY THE ARCADE HIT GAUNTLET. AS THE EPONYMOUS HERO, YOUR JOB IS TO DESTROY FOUR MAGIC SKULLS HIDDEN OVER EIGHT LEVELS. 

THE GAME IS PRESENTED IN A TOP-DOWN VIEW. THE DRUID WALKS AROUND THE TERRAIN SEEKING OUT THE STAIRCASE THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ON THE WAY, HE IS HARASSED BY HORDES OF MONSTERS THAT COME OUT OF EVERY DIRECTION AND ATTACK HIM, DECREASING HIS HEALTH. TO DEFEND HIMSELF, THE DRUID CAN USE THE SPELLS OF WATER, FIRE OR ELECTRICITY TO TOSS PROJECTILES. HOWEVER, THESE MAGICAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO. 

THE DRUID ALSO HAS THREE OTHER MAGICAL SPELLS AT HIS DISPOSAL - AN INVISIBILITY SPELL WHICH PREVENTS THE MONSTERS FROM AUTOMATICALLY APPROACHING HIM, A GOLEM SPELL WHICH SUMMONS A HELPFUL GOLEM (WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY A SECOND PLAYER), AND A SKULL SPELL WHICH DESTROYS ALL ON-SCREEN ENEMIES. THE DRUID ALSO CARRIES AROUND KEYS WHICH OPEN LOCKED DOORS. BUT ALL THESE HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES. 

ON HIS WAY, THE DRUID FINDS MANY SHOPS. EACH SUCH SHOP CONTAINS SOME KEYS OR CHARGES FOR THE DRUID'S SPELLS, BUT THE DRUID CAN ONLY PICK ONE ITEM FROM EACH SHOP. 

THE DRUID CAN ALSO COME ACROSS A PENTAGRAM ON THE GROUND WHICH WILL RESTORE HIS LOST HEALTH.</desc>

	<path>./Dynamite Dan (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>DYNAMITE DAN</name>
	<desc>THE GAME STARTS WHERE DAN LANDS HIS AIRSHIP ON THE TOP OF THE EVIL DR BLITZEN'S HIDEOUT. THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO FIND EIGHT STICKS OF DYNAMITE THAT ARE PLACED RANDOMLY AROUND THE PLAYING AREA WHILST AVOIDING THE PERILS OF THE GAME SUCH AS MOVING MONSTERS, DROWNING AND FALLING FROM GREAT HEIGHTS. ONCE DAN HAS ALL EIGHT STICKS OF DYNAMITE, THE PLAYER MUST MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE CENTRAL SAFE TO BLOW IT OPEN AND STEAL THE PLANS FOR THE EVIL DOCTOR'S DEATH RAY AND ESCAPE TO HIS AIRSHIP.

THE PLAYING AREA IS ESSENTIALLY ONE LARGE BUILDING SPLIT UP INTO MULTIPLE SCREENS THAT WRAP AROUND A CENTRAL ELEVATOR. EACH SCREEN CONTAINS A NUMBER OF MOVING MONSTERS THAT, ONCE THE PLAYER MOVES INTO THEM, ARE DESTROYED BUT TAKE OFF A LIFE IN RETURN. THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO BEING DESTROYED ONCE WALKED INTO ARE DR BLITZEN AND HIS ASSISTANT DONNER (DONNER AND BLITZEN) WHO ARE BOTH LOCATED ON THE SAME SCREEN AS THE SAFE. OTHER PERILS TO DAN'S LIFE INCLUDE RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY (CAUSED BY NOT COLLECTING ENOUGH FOOD, FALLING FROM HEIGHTS AND BEING HIT BY LASER BEAMS). IF DAN SHOULD ALSO FALL INTO THE UNDERGROUND RIVER THAT FLOWS BENEATH THE BUILDING, THE PLAYER WILL RECEIVE A GAME OVER UNLESS DAN HAD PICKED UP OXYGEN, IN WHICH CASE THEY WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE START OF THE GAME.

ONCE COMPLETED, THE GAME GIVES YOU A SECRET CODE TO DECIPHER AND A NUMBER TO CALL ONCE YOU HAVE THE ANSWER. WHILE THE NUMBER NO LONGER WORKS NOW, THE PRIZE WAS A RIDE IN THE MIRRORSOFT BLIMP.

A SEQUEL, DYNAMITE DAN 2, WAS RELEASED THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHICH FEATURED AROUND 200 ROOMS.

THE BACKGROUND MUSIC WHEN CHOOSING THE GAME SETTINGS AND WAITING FOR THE GAME TO START IS THE THIRD MOVEMENT (RONDO ALLA TURCA) FROM WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART'S PIANO SONATA NO. 11 IN A MAJOR, K. 331.</desc>

	<name>DYNASTY WARS</name>
	<desc>CONVERSION OF THE CAPCOM ARCADE TO HOME COMPUTERS. THE PLAYER ADOPTS THE IDENTITY OF AN ANCIENT CHINESE WARRIOR, AND RIDING ON HORSEBACK HAS TO ELIMINATE ALL HIS OPPONENTS, MOSTLY INFANTRY AND ARCHERS.

THE GAME USES A LATERAL SCROLL AND THE PLAYER CAN MOVE IN ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS. A NOVELTY IS THE ATTACK SYSTEM: WHEN PRESSING FIRE THE ENERGY OF THE ATTACK WILL LOAD UP AS THE WARRIOR MOVES HIS SPEAR UP AND BACKWARDS, IN ORDER TO GAIN MOMENTUM. THE MORE THE PLAYER CAN KEEP FIRE PRESSED, THE MORE POWERFUL THE ATTACK WILL BE.

THE GAME SPAWNED A SEQUEL IN THE ARCADES, "WARRIORS OF FATE", AND IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE PSX GAME OF THE SAME TITLE, WHICH IS A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTING GAME.</desc>

LIKE MOST CHILD-ORIENTED LICENSES OF THE DAY, HIS FIRST COMPUTER OUTING WAS A PLATFORM GAME, SCROLLING VERTICALLY AND RESEMBLING RAINBOW ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH MUCH SIMPLIFIED.

EDD MUST PROGRESS UP THE LEVELS WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT (WATER WILL COME UP TO DROWN HIM - PRESUMABLY POLLUTED WATER THROUGH WHICH A DUCK CAN'T SWIM), WHILE COLLECTING EVERY STAR. BAD GUYS CAN BE STUNNED BY SHOOTING THEM, WHICH MAKES THEM SAFE TO TOUCH, ALTHOUGH NOTHING OTHER THAN EDD ACTUALLY DIES. THE LEVELS ARE ALL THEMED AROUND PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE BBC OFFICES, INCLUDING A SCI-FI SET AND THE WEATHER ROOM.</desc>

THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT TERRAIN FOR YOU TO RACE ON INCLUDING DESERT BEACH AND DIRT TRACKS PLUS A NUMBER OF THINGS TO SLOW YOU DOWN OR EVEN KNOCK YOU OFF OF YOUR BIKE ALL TOGETHER. THE MAIN IDEA IS TO FIND THE BEST ROUTE THROUGH EACH LEVEL TO SHAVE OFF VALUABLE SECONDS IN ORDER TO OVER TAKE MORE CARS AND BIKES.

THE JAPANESE VERSION OF THE GAME HAS MORE TRACKS THAN THE EUROPEAN AND US VERSIONS HAVE. AMONG  THEM IS A SNOW TRACK WHICH IS ONE OF THE HARDEST TRACKS IN THE GAME, BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF STONES ON THE THIN ROAD.</desc>

YOUR TASK IS TO PROGRESS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN EACH LEVEL, EITHER ALONG THE GROUND OR BY USING THE ARRANGEMENT OF PLATFORMS. MOST OF THE BADDIES CAN BE AVOIDED RATHER THAN SHOT, AND THIS IS OFTEN EASIER, ESPECIALLY AS YOU CAN DUCK OR JUMP TO AVOID THEM. AS WELL AS A STANDARD GUN (ACTIVATED BY TAPPING FIRE) YOU ALSO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MISSILES TO TAKE OUT INSTALLATIONS (ACTIVATED BY HOLDING DOWN FIRE, WHICH MAKES AUTOFIRE FACILITIES USELESS). THE SCROLLING IS FLICK-SCREEN, PERHAPS AS THE GAME WAS DESIGNED FOR THE C64, AND THE AMIGA VERSION WAS IDENTICAL TO THE ST'S.</desc>

THE FIRST LEVEL INVOLVES FLYING AROUND IN A SHIP SHOOTING OUT ALIENS, WITH CONTACT DEPLETING YOUR ENERGY (AND CAUSING THE SCREEN BORDER TO FLASH). THE SECOND SECTION INVOLVES TRAVELLING UNDERWATER, RUNNING INTO LANDMINES TO SET OFF EXPLOSIONS TO KILL SURROUNDING ENEMIES.

FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS A COMMANDO CLONE, SCROLLING VERTICALLY AND WITH HORDES OF ENEMIES TO BE TAKEN ON, WITH FINDING GOOD SHIELDING SPOTS AND LAUNCHING SURPRISE ATTACKS AN ESPECIALLY USEFUL STRATEGY.YOU HAVE UNLIMITED BULLETS AND LIMITED BUT COLLECTIBLE GRENADES TO USE. THERE ARE LANDMINES TO AVOID, AND MEDICAL PACKS TO PICK UP.

ON EACH OF THE 8 LEVELS YOU MUST DESTROY FERNANDEZ'S BUILDINGS, WHICH ARE ACCESSED THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK OF TUNNELS. YOU'RE NOT LIMITED TO BEING ON FOOT - YOU START OFF IN A JEEP AND CAN ALSO USE MOTORBIKES, TANKS AND SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH LOSING A LIFE DESTROYS THIS. IN 2-PLAYER MODE YOU CAN SPLIT DRIVING AND GUNNING DUTIES. WHEN STARTING A NEW GAME, YOU ALWAYS START FROM THE POINT AT WHICH YOU DIED IN THE LAST GAME.</desc>

COLLECTING HERBS TO CAST SPELLS IS THE MAIN BASIS OF THE GAME. THERE ARE 24 HERBS AND FLOWERS TO BE COLLECTED, WHICH ARE USED TO MAKE ONE OF 12 SPELLS (THE HERBS ARE ONLY USED FOR 1 SPELL, SO THERES NO NEED TO DECIDE WHICH SPELL YOUD PREFER TO HAVE ACCESS TO). YOU CAN USE A COMBINATION OF THE SPELLS (INCLUDING A TELEPORTER, INVISIBILITY AND A FIREBALL, WHICH YOU MUST WORK OUR HOW TO USE).

	<name>THE FIFTH QUADRANT</name>
	<desc>AFTER 20 YEARS IN SPACE, THE ORION HAS FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED ITS TASK OF GALAXY MAPPING. ONLY ONE SMALL NEBULA REMAINS, BUT WHILE MAKING THE INTERGALACTIC JUMP, THE ORION IS TAKEN OVER BY AN ALIEN RACE KNOWN AS THE ZIMEN.

IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THE ZIMEN, THE PLAYERS CONTROL FOUR ROBOTS - CAPTAIN SLOG, PLOT THE NAVIGATOR, ENGINEER KNUT, AND ABLE SPACEMAN BODD - WHICH THEY USE ONE AT A TIME. EACH ROBOT IS SITUATED IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SHIP. SOME ROBOTS CAN EASILY NAVIGATE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MAZE OF 230 ROOMS, WHILE OTHERS ARE TEMPORARILY TRAPPED IN THEIR ROOMS.

WHEN A ROBOT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THE ZIMEN, ITS ENERGY IS QUICKLY DRAINED. WHEN ALL OF ITS ENERGY IS DEPLETED, THE ROBOT WILL STOP FUNCTIONING, AND THE ONLY WAY IT CAN BE RESTORED IS IF A PASSING ROBOT TRANSFERS ITS ENERGY WITH THE NON-FUNCTIONAL ONE.

THE ZIMEN MATERIALIZES SUDDENLY IN THE ORION'S PASSAGEWAYS WITH DEADLY PERSISTANCE, AND CAN EASILY TRAP THE OUTNUMBERED CREW INTO A CORNER. TO HELP THEM, THE ROBOTS CAN THROW BOUNCING BOMBS AT THE ZIMEN, GAINING POINTS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. 

CONTROL PANELS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SHIP GIVE A ROBOT ACCESS TO CODE SCREENS. WHEN DECODED, THESE WILL UNLOCK MATTER-TRANSMITTERS AND LIFTS, MEANING THAT THE ROBOT CREW CAN MOVE THROUGH THE SHIP AND CLOSER TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL: LOCKING INTO THE BRIDGE COMPUTER. WHEN ALL FOUR HAVE DONE THIS, THE ORION WILL BE SAFE.</desc>

ROUNDS LAST ONE MINUTE, WITH A SHORT BREAK IN BETWEEN THEM. AS IN THE REAL SPORT, YOUR AIM IS TO KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT DOWN FOR 10 SECONDS, BY GRADUALLY WEAKENING HIM WITH A SERIES OF PUNCHES. YOU CAN BLOCK PUNCHES, TO AVOID THEM INFLICTING DAMAGE ONTO YOU. THE RING IS OF A LIMITED SIZE, SO PLAYERS CAN BE CORNERED, ALTHOUGH THE REFEREE WILL INTERVENE TO BREAK THE BOXERS UP IF THEY BECOME ENTANGLED IN A STALEMATE POSITION.

YOU START WITH 10 'GOAL CARDS' - UP TO 3 CAN BE PLAYED IN EACH MATCH, EACH OF THEM GIVING YOU A SHOOTING CHANCE, AT WHICH POINT ARCADE ACTION SKILL COMES IN. THE BETTER YOU PERFORM, THE HIGHER YOUR WAGES ARE, THE MORE CHANCE YOU HAVE OF A BIG-MONEY TRANSFER AND INTERNATIONAL CALL-UP, AND THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF BEING DROPPED FROM THE TEAM.

THERE'S ALSO A TRIVIA SECTION, WHICH ASKS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ALLOWING YOU TO GO DOUBLE OR NOTHING ON KNOWING THE ANSWERS - UP TO £8000 A TIME CAN BE WON ON THIS.</desc>

	<desc>FORMER BOXING WORLD CHAMPION FRANK BRUNO, FAMED FOR HIS CATCHPHRASE "YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, HARRY?" AND MORE RECENTLY HIS HEROIC BATTLE WITH DEPRESSION, PUT HIS NAME  TO THIS BOXING GAME WHICH REPLICATES PUNCH-OUT. AS FRANK, YOU MUST TAKE ON 8 PROGRESSIVELY TOUGH BOXERS TO WIN THE TITLE.  

THE ACTION IS VIEWED FROM RIGHT BEHIND FRANK IN 3D, MEANING THAT YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL THE FULL IMPACT OF PUNCHES. A FULL RANGE OF MOVES IS PROVIDED, WITH THE STANDARD JABS COMPLIMENTED BY BODY PUNCHES AND THE ABILITY TO DODGE, DUCK OR RAISE YOUR GUARD.

EACH PUNCH WEAKENS YOUR OPPONENT'S STRENGTH, ALTHOUGH GOING LONG ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING HIT CAN SEE THIS BEGIN TO RECOVER. A RAIN OF BLOWS CAN PRODUCE A QUICK KNOCKOUT, BUT IN GENERAL YOU MUST HIT HIM MANY TIMES, AND THEN WITH A KNOCKOUT BLOW, TO SEE HIM GO DOWN.</desc>

	<name>GAPLUS</name>
	<desc>GAPLUS IS A SEQUEL TO GALAGA AND HAS SIMILAR GAMEPLAY. THE PLAYER CONTROLS A SPACESHIP, THAT CAN NOW MOVE VERTICALLY (LIMITED TO HALFWAY UP THE SCREEN) AS WELL AS HORIZONTALLY, AND SHOOTS AT SWARMS OF INCOMING INSECT-LIKE ALIENS WHICH FLY IN FORMATION ABOVE IT AND SWOOP DOWN TO BOMB IT IN A KAMIKAZE-LIKE DIVE. IN THIS SEQUEL, THE LEVEL STARTS OVER IF THE PLAYER IS KILLED BEFORE ALL THE ENEMIES HAVE COME IN. WHEN ALL ENEMIES ARE DESTROYED, THE PLAYER MOVES ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL. BY OBTAINING CERTAIN POWER-UPS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHOOT 60 BULLETS PER SCREEN, THE MOST ANY GALAGA RELATED GAME HAS.</desc>

	<name>GARY LINEKER'S SUPERSTAR SOCCER</name>
	<desc>MUCH OF THE DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING OF SUPERSTAR ICE HOCKEY (BY MANY OF THE SAME PROGRAMMERS) IS REVISED TO PROVIDE A SIX-A-SIDE SOCCER GAME. YOU CAN CONTROL ANY COMBINATION OF CENTRE-FORWARD, GOALKEEPER (ON THE C64) AND MANAGER. FOR MUCH OF THE GAME YOU ARE MERELY THE CENTRE-FORWARD AS THE ACTION UNFOLDS AROUND YOU - DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRACK BACK AND HELP OUT. 

THE BALL STICKS CLOSELY TO A PLAYER, WHO CAN PASS, SHOOT, HEAD OR BICYCLE-KICK IT. GOALKEEPERS ARE PENALISED FOR RETAINING POSSESSION FOR TOO LONG (A RULE LATER ADAPTED FOR USE IN REAL-LIFE FOOTBALL). MATCH LENGTH CAN BE BETWEEN 6 AND 90 MINUTES, BY TOGGLING THE SPEED AT WHICH TIME MOVES. FOULS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

SINGLE MATCHES CAN BE PLAYED IN THE CASSETTE VERSION, BUT THE DISK VERSION ADDS A FULL-SEASON STRUCTURE. 64 ENGLISH TEAMS ARE SPLIT INTO 4 DIVISIONS OF 16, WITH A SEASON CONSISTING OF EITHER 7 OR 15 MATCHES.</desc>

	<name>GAUNTLET</name>
	<desc>GAUNTLET, THE ORIGINAL ARCADE SMASH HIT, IS A FIGHTING GAME WHERE YOU CHOOSE A CHARACTER AND LET RIP INTO THE HORDES OF ENEMIES THAT ASSAULT YOU ON YOU WAY TO THE END OF THE LEVEL. ONE OR TWO PLAYERS MUST MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH 100 LEVELS OF MAYHEM AND MAGIC. 

IT FEATURED A CHOICE OF FOUR CHARACTERS TO PLAY WITH, EACH WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS. THOR THE WARRIOR, HAS A  BLUDGEONING BATTLE AXE, THYRA THE VALKYRIE, HAS A CLOSE RANGE SWORD, QUESTOR THE ELF HAS HIS LONG RANGE BOW, AND MERLIN THE WIZARD HAS MAGICAL BOLTS.

GHOSTS, GOBLINS AND EVEN THE LIFE DRAINING DEATH ARE YOUR ENEMIES. ENEMIES STREAM OUT OF GENERATORS, SO DESTROY THESE BEFORE TACKLING THE REST. 

KEYS ARE NEEDED TO OPEN THE MANY DOORS WITHIN THE LEVELS, AND IN SOME SITUATIONS A DOOR WILL CONTAIN ONLY BONUS ITEMS, NOT A PROGRESSIVE ROUTE.  SCATTERED MAGIC POTIONS ACT LIKE SMART BOMBS AND CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ALL ENEMIES. BEWARE OF POISON THOUGH, THIS REDUCES YOUR ENERGY LEVEL.
TREASURE IS ABUNDANT THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS AND ADDS TO YOUR SCORE.</desc>

THERE WERE UP TO 14 CIRCUITS DEPENDING ON THE FORMAT, WHICH INCORPORATED MANY UNDERPASSES (SOME OF THEM DELIBERATELY UNREALISTIC) AND TIGHT CURVES. THERE WERE OIL SLICKS TO AVOID AND POINTS BONUSES TO PICK UP.

THE CARS HAVE SLOW ACCELERATION BUT A LOT OF POWER DOWN THE STRAIGHTS. YOU ARE SCORED BASED ON YOUR OVERALL TIME AND YOUR FASTEST LAP. LOSE TO THE COMPUTER CAR AND IT'S GAME OVER.</desc>

THE TWO MAIN NEW FEATURES ARE A 3-PLAYER MODE (THERE ARE ALWAYS 3 CARS PRESENT IN TOTAL) AND A DAMAGE METER WHICH MEAN THAT REPEAT CONTRACT WITH BARRIERS OR OTHER CARS HAMPERS YOUR PERFORMANCE.</desc>

	<name>THE GREAT ESCAPE</name>
	<desc>THE GREAT ESCAPE IS AN ISOMETRIC ACTION-ADVENTURE GAME.

GATHER ROUND, KIDS, AND LISTEN TO GRANDPA TELL OF HIS TIME AS A PRISONER OF WAR IN GERMANY. TWAS BACK IN 1942. THOSE WERE ROUGH TIMES, LADS. ROUGH TIMES. BEEN SHOT DOWN IN MY PLANE. DARN SHAME IT WAS, IT BEING A GOOD PLANE AND ALL. NEXT I KNOW, THERES THIS GROUP OF GERMAN SOLDIERS STANDING ROUND ME, AND OFF WE GO TO A P.O.W. CAMP. BIG THING, THAT, PLENTY OF GUARDS ALL AROUND WITH A KEEN EYE ON YOUR EVERY MOVE, AND FULL OF UNFORTUNATE SOULS LIKE MYSELF. JUST THAT THEY DO NAUGHT BUT SIT ALL DAY AND SOB AND GENERALLY BE NO GREAT HELP WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THE GREAT ESCAPE. BUT NOT ME, NO SIR! I SHOWED THEM GERMANS, I DID, AND I WAS OUT OF THEIR FASHIONABLE HIGH SECURITY HE WHO COMES HERE, STAYS HERE CAMP IN NO TIME. YOU WANNA HEAR THAT STORY? BET YOU DO!

CONTROLLING A PRISONER OF WAR IN A GERMAN CAMP, YOUR GOAL IS TO BREAK OUT UNDETECTED. THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO FREEDOM  BACK DOORS, CRACKED FENCES, EVEN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE TO PLAN YOUR ESCAPE WHILE OBEYING THE STRICT RULES OF THE CAMP. 

NUMBER ONE: DAILY PROGRAM. YOU HAVE TO ATTEND TWO ROLL CALLS A DAY, ONE MEAL, ONE EXERCISE, AND STAY IN BED AT NIGHT. FAILURE TO APPEAR AT ANY OF THESE EVENTS WILL RESULT IN THE ALARM BEING RUNG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CONTROLS, YOUR PROTAGONIST WILL MOVE AUTOMATICALLY, GOING TO ALL IMPORTANT EVENTS. YOU HAVE TO DETECT AND USE GAPS IN THE TIME-TABLE TO EXPLORE THE CAMP. 

RULE NUMBER TWO: GUARD ROOMS ARE OFF LIMITS. IF A SOLDIER CATCHES YOU IN A ROOM THAT IS FORBIDDEN, YOU WILL BE PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO ENTER RESTRICTED PARTS OF THE CAMP TO FIND ITEMS CRUCIAL FOR YOUR ESCAPE. THE MORAL FLAG WILL TURN FROM GREEN TO RED TO INDICATE THAT YOU ARE IN AN AREA WHERE YOU SHOULDNT BE. 

RULE NO THREE: NO PRISONER MAY CARRY FORBIDDEN OBJECTS. WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT IN A SUSPICIOUS SITUATION, YOU WILL BE STRIPPED OF ALL ITEMS THAT YOU FOUND SO FAR. TO AVOID THAT, YOU HAVE TO DEPOSIT OBJECTS IN A SAFE PLACE. YOU NEED TO FIND KEYS TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS, UNIFORMS FOR CAMOUFLAGE, FLASHLIGHTS TO SEE IN DARK TUNNELS, AND MANY MORE. 

RULE NUMBER FOUR: GUARD COMMANDS ARE TO BE OBEYED AT ALL TIMES. THE GERMAN SOLDIERS PATROL ON FIXED ROUTES AND HAVE A LINE OF SIGHT. YOU HAVE TO LEARN THE GUARDS ROUTES AND SNEAK PAST THEIR BACKS TO AVOID DETECTION WHEN BREAKING OUT. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT, YOUR MORALE WILL DECREASE. IF YOUR MORALE REACHES ZERO, YOUR WILL TO ESCAPE IS BROKEN.</desc>

	<desc>RELEASING A GAME WHICH RESEMBLES A WELL-KNOWN ARCADE GAME BEFORE ANY OFFICIAL LICENSE CAN BE RELEASED WAS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE FOR PUBLISHERS, AND IN THIS CASE MELBOURNE HOUSE RELEASED A GAME SIMILAR TO MARBLE MADNESS. CONTROLLING A GYROSCOPE, YOU MOST NAVIGATE YOUR WAY DOWN A SLOPING TRACK FULL OF HAZARDS. THE VIEWPOINT IS IN FIXED ISOMETRIC 3D, WITH HAZARDS INCLUDING BUILDINGS, RAMPS AND DROPS. THE GYROSCOPE ACCELERATES QUICKLY AND TAKES TIME TO SLOW DOWN, SO IT IS EASY TO GO INTO A SCREEN TOO FAST.

FAILING TO KEEP THE GYROSCOPE SPINNING FREELY AS IT NAVIGATES THESE COSTS YOU ONE OF YOUR SEVEN LIVES. YOU ARE ALSO PLAYING WITHIN A TIME LIMIT - LOSING A LIFE SEES YOU RETURN TO THE START OF A LEVEL WITHOUT REGAINING LOST TIME, BUT RUNNING OUT OF TIME SEES YOU LOSE A LIFE, BUT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE FROM WHERE YOU WERE LEFT WITH A NEW SET OF TIME (SO, AS WITH CHASE HQ, COMPLETING TRICKY LEVELS CAN TAKE 2 OR 3 LIVES AT FIRST). 

YOU GET TIME BONUSES FOR COMPLETING A SCREEN, POINTS BONUSES FOR COMPLETING ONE OF THE SEVEN FOUR-SCREEN LEVELS, AND AN EXTRA LIFE FOR REACHING 1000 POINTS.
AT THE END OF LEVEL 7, YOU WILL GET 1000 POINTS FOR EACH REMAINING LIVES, DOUBLING YOUR CURRENT AMOUNT OF LIVES. YOU WILL THEN START AGAIN AT LEVEL 1 BUT MIRRORED BY THE VERTICAL AXIS (YOU ARE NOW CLIMBING FROM THE BOTTOM OF SCREEN TO THE TOP).
AFTER LEVEL 14 (LEVEL 7 MIRROR), YOU WILL AGAIN WIN 1000 POINTS FOR EACH REMAINING LIVES AND THEN THE GAME LOOP ON LEVEL 1 (NOT MIRRORED).</desc>

TO HELP ON YOUR MISSION, RODERICK HERO HAS SEVERAL USEFUL TYPES OF EQUIPMENT. A PROP PACK WILL ALLOW YOU TO HOVER AND FLY AROUND THE MINESHAFT AND (HOPEFULLY) AVOID THE MANY DANGERS WITHIN. YOUR HELMET FEATURES A SHORT RANGE MICROLASER BEAM WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY THE BATS, SPIDERS, SNAKES, AND OTHER CREATURES YOU'LL ENCOUNTER IN THE MINES. FROM TIME TO TIME, YOUR PATH THROUGH THE MINE MAY BE BLOCKED BY STONE OR LAVA WALLS. YOU BEGIN EACH MISSION WITH SIX STICKS OF DYNAMITE WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY THESE OBSTACLES (BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T BLOW YOURSELF UP, THOUGH!) IF YOU RUN OUT OF DYNAMITE, YOUR LASER BEAM CAN ALSO BE USED TO DESTROY THE WALLS, THOUGH THIS WILL TAKE LONGER AND USE UP MORE ENERGY. AS THE LEVELS PROGRESS, THE MINE SHAFT WILL BECOME LONGER AND MORE MAZE-LIKE, CREATURES WILL MORE FREQUENTLY BLOCK THE PATH, AND LAVA WALLS AND POOLS WILL APPEAR WHICH ARE DANGEROUS TO THE TOUCH.</desc>

TO HELP ON YOUR MISSION, RODERICK HERO HAS SEVERAL USEFUL TYPES OF EQUIPMENT. A PROP PACK WILL ALLOW YOU TO HOVER AND FLY AROUND THE MINESHAFT AND (HOPEFULLY) AVOID THE MANY DANGERS WITHIN. YOUR HELMET FEATURES A SHORT RANGE MICROLASER BEAM WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY THE BATS, SPIDERS, SNAKES, AND OTHER CREATURES YOU'LL ENCOUNTER IN THE MINES. FROM TIME TO TIME, YOUR PATH THROUGH THE MINE MAY BE BLOCKED BY STONE OR LAVA WALLS. YOU BEGIN EACH MISSION WITH SIX STICKS OF DYNAMITE WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESTROY THESE OBSTACLES (BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T BLOW YOURSELF UP, THOUGH!) IF YOU RUN OUT OF DYNAMITE, YOUR LASER BEAM CAN ALSO BE USED TO DESTROY THE WALLS, THOUGH THIS WILL TAKE LONGER AND USE UP MORE ENERGY. AS THE LEVELS PROGRESS, THE MINE SHAFT WILL BECOME LONGER AND MORE MAZE-LIKE, CREATURES WILL MORE FREQUENTLY BLOCK THE PATH, AND LAVA WALLS AND POOLS WILL APPEAR WHICH ARE DANGEROUS TO THE TOUCH.</desc>

	<desc>HACKER IS AN ADVENTURE/TRADING GAME BASED ON WHAT WAS THEN A UNIQUE IDEA. YOU'RE STARTING INTO THE ADVENTURE AS A REAL HACKER WOULD DO, LACKING INFORMATION OF WHAT IS TO COME, ONLY DRIVEN BY YOUR AMBITION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE GAME OPENS WITH A PLAIN TEXT SCREEN, PROMPTING YOU FOR THE LOGIN PASSWORD. TO BREAK INTO THE SYSTEM IS THE FIRST PUZZLE YOU'VE GOT TO SOLVE.

ONCE IN, YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT THAT YOU'VE ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED UPON A CONSPIRACY OF GLOBAL IMPACT. FROM THEN ON, YOU'LL MANEUVER A ROBOTIC DRONE AROUND THE GLOBE THROUGH A TUNNEL SYSTEM DEEP IN THE EARTH. IN MAJOR CITIES, YOU MAY SURFACE AND TALK TO CONTACT PERSONS, WHO'LL TRADE ITEMS FOR CASH. WHEN DELIVERED TO THE CORRECT CITY, YOU CAN EXCHANGE THESE ITEMS FOR A PIECE OF EVIDENCE. IF ALL EVIDENCE IS COLLECTED, YOU'RE TO INFORM THE FBI. AS IF FIGURING OUT THE CORRECT ROUTES AND TRADES WASN'T HARD ENOUGH, FREQUENT SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS AND SECURITY CHECKS TEST YOUR SKILL AS WELL...</desc>

	<desc>HARD DRIVIN' IS A 3D ARCADE HIT FROM ATARI GAMES. YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPORTS CAR. YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO RACE AROUND THE COURSE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND HIT AS MANY CHECKPOINTS AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU HIT A CHECKPOINT YOU GAIN EXTRA TIME TO GO FARTHER. YOU WILL SEE TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD BOTH IN YOUR DIRECTION AND COMING DOWN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU PASS... 

THE COURSE HAS TWO SECTIONS: SPEED TRACK, AND STUNT TRACK. SPEED TRACK IS LONGER, BUT YOU CAN USUALLY ACHIEVE HIGHER SPEEDS. STUNT TRACK REQUIRES YOU TO PERFORM SEVERAL STUNTS SUCH AS JUMPING BRIDGES, DRIVING THROUGH A LOOP, AND SO ON. 

CRASHING THE CAR HAS NO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND INDEED SHOWS A REPLAY OF YOUR CRASH FROM A CINEMATIC ANGLE. ADMIRE YOUR CRASH HEAD-ON INTO THE CEMENT TRUCK, OR CLIPPING THE MINIVAN, OR FLYING OFF THE BRIDGE IN THE WRONG ANGLE... YOU LOSE SEVERAL SECONDS AS YOUR CAR IS "RESET" AND YOU GET UP TO SPEED AGAIN. 

THE HOME CONVERSIONS RETAIN MOST OF THE THEN-ADVANCED 3D GRAPHICS BUT LACK THE FORCE-FEEDBACK THAT WAS IN THE ARCADE VERSION.</desc>

	<desc>THE TOWN OF THE GAME'S HERO IS UNDER A CURSE FROM AN EVIL WIZARD. HE HAS STOLEN THE GOLDEN TALISMAN THAT HAD PROTECTED THE CITY IN THE PAST. BROKEN INTO FIVE PIECES, THE TALISMAN IS HIDDEN IN A LABYRINTH FILLED WITH MONSTERS. NOW THE HERO HAS TO FIND ALL FIVE PIECES OF THE TALISMAN AND DESTROY THE EVIL WIZARD IN ORDER TO RESTORE PEACE TO THE CITY.

THE LABYRINTH IS EXPLORED FROM A SIDE SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE. IT IS COMPOSED OF 64 ROOM SPREAD OVER FIVE LEVELS. EACH ROOM IS 8 SCREENS LARGE, PROVIDING A TOTAL OF 512 SCREENS TO EXPLORE. THE GOAL OF EACH LEVEL IS TO FIND A PIECE OF THE TALISMAN WHILE FIGHTING OFF LOTS OF DIFFERENT MONSTERS RANGING FROM BIRDS TO JUMPING EYEBALLS TO FIRE-BREATHING DRAGONS. 

THE HERO CAN JUMP, CLIMB ROPES, SWIM AND SHOOT AS WELL AS PICK UP DIFFERENT POWER-UPS AND OBJECTS. HE CAN CARRY FIVE OBJECTS, BUT ONLY HOLD/USE ONE AT A TIME. PRESSING THE SPACE BAR CHANGES THE OBJECT IN USE. USABLE OBJECTS INCLUDE KEYS, ROPES, LAMPS TO LIGHT DARK ROOMS, FLAGS THAT IMPROVE THE HERO'S FIREPOWER AND OTHERS. 

POWER-UPS CAN BE COLLECTED TO REPLENISH HEALTH OR AIR. IF THE HERO RUNS OUT OF AIR, BEING UNDERWATER WILL SLOWLY DECREASE HIS HEALTH. TO HELP THE HERO FINDING HIS WAY THROUGH THE LABYRINTH, A MAP IS SHOWN AT THE LOWER LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. IT MARKS ALL VISITED ROOMS, SHOWS HIS CURRENT POSITION AND INDICATES WHETHER THERE ARE ANY ITEMS IN A ROOM.</desc>

THESE MOVES ARE CARRIED OUT USING AN ICON-BASED SYSTEM. CHARACTERS CAN FIGHT THE MANY MONSTERS WHICH LURK, OR CAST SPELLS TO VANQUISH THEM.

THE GAME IS PLAYED VIA AN ICON CONTROL SYSTEM, WITH A COMMON SET OF ICONS AND INFORMATION PANELS ARE DISPLAYED AROUND THESE SCREENS. THERE ARE SIX DISTINCT SCREENS USED TO MAKE THE DECISIONS, PLUS THE ABILITY TO TRACK EXISTING SATELLITES AND KEEP TRACK OF ACTIVE SOVIET ATTACKS.

THE RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT SCREEN IS THE FIRST PORT OF CALL. IT IS SPLIT INTO SIX COMPONENTS, TO WHICH YOU MUST ASSIGN MONEY AND STAFF. THE PRESIDENT WILL GIVE THE ORDER TO ARM OR DISARM YOUR UNITS (INCLUDING THE ACTIVATION CODE). ONCE YOU HAVE WORKING SDIS AND THE PERMISSION CODES, YOU CAN LAUNCH THEM USING THE SHIELD SCREEN.

ESPIONAGE AND RECONNAISSANCE CAMERAS ARE LOCATED TO KEEP TRACK OF ENEMY DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH THESE FIGURES ARE NOT ALWAYS PRECISE. THE THREATS SCREEN LETS YOU KEEP TRACK OF ENEMY RESOURCES AND MOODS. THE WORLD SCREEN EFFECTIVELY MOVES THE GAME FORWARD IN TIME.</desc>

TAKING THE ROLE OF THE IMMORTAL HIGHLANDER CONNOR MACLEOD, THE PLAYER HAS TO WIN THREE CONSECUTIVE BATTLES AGAINST INCREASINGLY SKILLED OPPONENTS: MACLEOD'S TEACHER RAMIREZ, A CHARACTER NAMED FIZIR, AND FINALLY THE MIGHTY KURGAN, THE MAIN ANTAGONIST OF THE MOVIE.

A BATTLE IS WON BY DEPLETING THE ENEMY OF HIS ENERGY. ENERGY IS LOST BY BEING HIT, OR BY ATTEMPTING AN ATTACK THAT IS BLOCKED BY THE ENEMY. TO WIN, A COMBINATION OF ATTACKING AND PARRYING MOVES IS NECESSARY, OF WHICH SEVERAL ARE AVAILABLE DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTER'S STANCE (STANDING OR CROUCHED) AND THE DIRECTION THE JOYSTICK IS PUSHED.

TWO PLAYERS CAN ENGAGE IN A DUEL IN TWO-PLAYER MODE.</desc>

	<desc>A SIMPLE TWO-PLAYER GAME RELEASED TO MUCH MARKETING FANFARE, HOTSHOT PLACES YOU AND ANOTHER PLAYER (EITHER ANOTHER PERSON OR AN AI ROBOT) IN AN ARENA SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE INTO TWO SAVE FOR A HOLE ABOUT HALF THE SCREEN'S HEIGHT FOR THE BALL TO TRAVEL THROUGH, WITH A SERIES OF BRICKS ON EACH SIDE TO DESTROY.

THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO DESTROY YOUR OWN BRICKS BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT CAN DESTROY HIS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY CATCHING THE SMALL BY POINTING YOUR SUCTION DEVICE AT IT AND HOLDING FIRE, AND THEN RELEASING IN THE NEEDED BY LETTING GO OF THE BUTTON. THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE, AS THE BALL NEITHER MOVES IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL RULES OF.GRAVITY.

SHOULD EITHER PLAYER BE HIT WITH THE BALL AND NOT CATCH IT PROPERLY, THEY WILL BE KNOCKED DOWN AND POSSESSION OF THE BALL IS PASSED TO THE OTHER PLAYER.</desc>

	<desc>THIS GAME IS BASED AROUND CULT ALTERNATIVE COMEDIAN ADE EDMONDSONS BOOK OF THE SAME NAME. HAVING GATE-CRASHED A PARTY FULL OF SOPHISTICATED WELL-BEHAVED TYPES, YOU MUST DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO BE SEEN AS HATEFUL, YOBBISH AND IMMATURE  A COMPLETE BASTARD.

THE HOUSE HAS SEVERAL ROOMS, EACH OF WHICH ARE FILLED WITH OBJECTS WHICH ARE OF USE, AS WELL AS UNLIMITED SUPPLIES OF FOOD, ALCOHOL AND COFFEE, WHICH CONTROL HOW DRUNK YOU ARE AT A TIME  SOME AWFUL ACTIONS FORCE YOU TO BE SOBER, OTHERS FORCE YOU TO BE DRUNK. THE GAME ALSO DISPLAYS WHETHER YOU NEED THE TOILET (OR, MORE ACCURATELY, ANY PART OF THE HOUSE THAT WOULD CAUSE OFFENCE), WHETHER YOU NEED TO FART, AND HOW STRONG-SMELLING THESE ARE.

THE ROOMS CAN ALL BE VIEWED FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES, AND 2 CAN BE VIEWED AT A TIME THROUGH A SPLIT-SCREEN VIEW.

TO WIN, YOU NEED TO PROVE TO ALL 16 PARTY GUEST THAT YOU ARE A COMPLETE BASTARD.</desc>

IN THIS GAME, PLAYERS CONTROL KWON, DUBBED THE HUMAN KILLING MACHINE. HE HAS VOWED TO DEMONSTRATE THE POWER OF HIS HOMELAND; AND DOES THIS BY BATTLING A SERIES OF OPPONENTS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS MOSCOW, AMSTERDAM, AND BARCELONA. HKM USES THE TERM 'KNOCKDOWN' FOR PLAYERS WHO DEFEAT THEIR CURRENT OPPONENT. THREE KNOCKDOWNS ARE NEEDED FOR THE PLAYER TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT OPPONENT.

BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR THE REMAINING ENERGY KWON HAS WHEN HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEFEATED HIS OPPONENT. THE PLAYER HAS FIVE LIVES, AND IF ALL OF THEM ARE USED UP, THE GAME IS OVER.</desc>

SWIMMING INVOLVES MOVING LEFT AND RIGHT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, WHILE PRESSING FIRE WHEN A BREATH IS REQUIRED. SKEET SHOOTING AND ARCHERY BOTH COME DOWN TO TIMING - THOUGH ELEVATION AND WIND FACTORS AFFECT THE LATTER. GYMNASTICS INVOLVES TIMING A SUCCESSION OF PRESSES TO ENSURE THAT THE JUMP IS LONG AND THE LANDING GRACEFUL. THE TRIPLE JUMP INVOLVES ONE PRESS FOR EACH PART OF THE JUMP, WHEREAS THE WEIGHTLIFTING INVOLVES MERELY BRUTE STRENGTH.</desc>

	<name>HYPERBOWL</name>
	<desc>HYPERBOWL IS A ONE-ON-ONE FUTURISTIC SPORT VIEWED FROM ABOVE, WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE RECTANGULAR PITCH VISIBLE AT A TIME.  EACH PLAYER CONTROLS ONE OF THE 10 AVAILABLE SPACESHIPS, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SUBTLE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN TERMS OF SPEED, INERTIA AND FIRE DIRECTION. A SCANNER SHOWS THE POSITIONS OF BOTH SHIPS AND THE BALL, SO THAT THINGS DON'T BECOME DISORIENTATING.

THE AIM IS TO GUIDE THE BALL EITHER INTO A 'GOAL' IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH END (SCORING 2 POINTS) OR ONTO THE GOAL-LINE ELSEWHERE (SCORING ONE POINT). THE BALL CAN BE STEERED EITHER BY HITTING IT WITH THE SHIP OR BY SHOOTING AT IT WITH YOUR CRAFT'S BEAM (WHICH DOES NOT INJURE OR IMPEDE THE OPPOSITION CRAFT IN ANY WAY). IN EITHER CASE THE BALL MOVES IN A SEMI-RANDOM DIRECTION SIMILAR TO THE ONE YOU DIRECTED IT IN, BUT CAN REBOUND OFF THE PLUS-SHAPED DIVOTS IN THE WALL UNEXPECTEDLY.

THE GAME LASTS FOR 5 MINUTES, OR UNTIL A PLAYER REACHES THE WINNING SCORE OF 9. EACH OF THE THREE SKILLS LEVELS IS A 5-TIER TOURNAMENT OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY.</desc>

HOWEVER, AS YOU ATTEMPT TO DO THIS THE CHAMBER WALLS WILL ADVANCE UPON YOU, ABSORBING THE PODS AS THEY MOVE.YOU CAN SHOOT AT THE WALLS TO FORCE THEM TO RETREAT BUT AS THEY MOVE BACK WILL ERASE THE PODS BEHIND THEM. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DRAG BACK SOME OF THE WALLS, BUT ONCE AGAIN THE PODS WILL DISAPPEAR AS THE WALLS ARE PULLED BACK.</desc>

	<name>HYSTERIA</name>
	<desc>A FANATICAL SECT HAS CHANGED MANKIND'S FUTURE BY SUMMONING A PREVIOUSLY EXTINCT PRIMEVAL ENTITY IN OUR PAST. YOU, A SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE ONCE ELITE 'TIME CORPS' HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY THE FEDERATION OF LAW AND ORDER TO COMBAT THE ENTITY IN THREE TIME ZONES: ANCIENT GREECE, DARK AGES AND SPACE.

THE GAME, CONTROLLED BY JOYSTICK, HAS YOU MOVING THE TIME WARRIOR IN HORIZONTAL-SCROLLING PARALLAX LEVELS. YOU HAVE TO COLLECT NINE PIECES THAT ASSEMBLE TO A FACE OF THE PRIMEVAL ENTITY WHO MUST BE BATTLED.

MEANWHILE, THE LOCALS IN EACH TIME ZONE DO NOT LIKE TIME WARRIORS AND THROW AND FIRE EVERYTHING AT YOU. LUCKILY, YOU ARE CARRYING AN ENERGY CONVERSION KIT THAT CHANGES SOME SHOT OBJECTS AND ENEMIES INTO VALUABLE WEAPONS AND ARMOURY. GOOD LUCK, YOU WILL NEED IT!</desc>

	<desc>YOU WANT TO BECOME A SPECIAL AGENT FOR I.C.U.P.S. (INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR UNIVERSAL PROBLEM SOLVING), BUT BEFORE THEY CAN ACCEPT YOU, YOU HAVE TO PASS TWO TESTS THAT MAKE UP TWO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GAME.

THE FIRST PART IS SHOWN FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE. YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF A SPACE SHIP AND ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENEMIES. MOST ENEMY SHIPS ARE NOT LETHAL IN THEMSELVES, BUT HAVE EITHER THE ABILITY TO SHOOT UP, DOWN, OR SIDEWAYS. TO DEFEAT THEM, YOU CAN SHOOT UPWARDS OR PUSH THEM TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN.

THE SECOND PART OF THE GAME IS SHOWN FROM A SIDE-SCROLLING PERSPECTIVE AND BEGINS ONCE YOU REACH THE ENEMY STAR SHIP. IN IT, YOU CONTROL A ROBOT WITH A JET-PACK AND MUST FIND FOUR PARTS OF A BOMB THAT ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE LARGE SHIP, WHILE SHOOTING LOTS OF INSECT-LIKE ENEMIES.</desc>

ESCAPE WITH THE MINE CART AFTER YOU'VE FREED ALL CHILDREN.

SCRUMS AND LINE-OUTS ARE INCORPORATED FOR AS REALISTIC A GAME AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE PLAYER RESTRICTION. A TOURNAMENT CAN BE PLAYED WITH UP TO 8 PLAYERS, WITH AS MANY COMPUTER TEAMS AS REQUIRED TO FILL THE GAPS.

IN THE ST VERSION THE TACTICAL SIDE OF THE GAME IS VERY COMPLEX - SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT FORMATIONS ARE ON OFFER. OTHER GAMEPLAY VARIABLES CAN BE SET - PLAYER STAMINA (LOWER VALUES FORCING YOU TO PLAY A MORE CONSERVATIVE GAME), HOW LONG A PLAYER TAKES TO RECOVER FROM A TACKLE, AND THE STANDARD STRENGTHS OF PASSES AND KICKS, PUS SOME VERY COMPLICATED MATHEMATICAL COEFFICIENTS. THE ABILITY TO RENAME TEAMS, CHANGE KITS AND ALTER THE MATCH LENGTHS SEEM BANAL BY COMPARISON.</desc>

	<name>THE ISLAND OF DR. DESTRUCTO</name>
	<desc>YOU ARE LEADING A MISSION TO DESTROY DR. DESTRUCTO'S ARRAY OF SHIPS, AND ULTIMATELY HIS ISLAND HIDEOUT, OVER 21 LEVELS. YOU DO THIS BY FLYING A PLANE OVER A LIMITED AREA, AND SHOOTING HIS PLANES SO THAT THEY FALL AND INFLICT DAMAGE ON THE TARGET ITEM, WHICH IS LARGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. MULTIPLE SHOTS ON A PARTICULAR SPOT WILL ULTIMATELY CAUSE A WATER-SPOUT; THREE WATERSPOUTS AND THE SHIP (OR ISLAND) WILL SINK. 

SOME ENEMY BEINGS CAN BE SHOT DOWN, BUT OTHERS ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE AND REQUIRE EVASIVE ACTION. YOU ARE ALSO ARMED WITH A BOMB, WHICH CAN BE USED TO INFLICT PRECISE DAMAGE ONCE PER LEVEL. ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THIS GAME IS THAT IT USES A DAY/NIGHT CYCLE.</desc>

JOE BLADE IS VIEWED SIDE-ON AND USES FLICK-SCREEN PROGRESSION.

	<desc>AS PLAYERS SOFTWARE CORRECTLY PREDICTED, LONDON IN 1995 IS AN UNFRIENDLY UNSAFE CITY RAN BY THUGS. INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO LEAVE THE HOUSE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY FACE VIOLENCE. AN ACCLAIMED HERO SINCE HIS SUCCESSES IN THE ORIGINAL, JOE BLADE IS THE MAN TO PUT THINGS RIGHT - IF HE CAN KILL 100 THUGS AND RESCUE 20 CIVILIANS WITHIN TEN MINUTES, THE THUGS WILL RETREAT AND THE CITY WILL BE SAVED.

AS JOE, YOU MUST MOVE THROUGH THE STREETS AND KILL THESE THUGS, BY KICKING THEM IN THE HEAD (THEY HAVE BODY ARMOUR). AS IN THE FIRST GAME, THE STREETS ARE FLICK-SCREEN AND HAVE MANY DOORWAYS LINKING THEM. RESCUING CIVILIANS INVOLVES TOUCHING THEM BEFORE COMPLETING A SUB-GAME WITHIN A MINUTE.

THERE ARE FOUR SUBGAME VARIANTS OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY, ALL BASED AROUND A 1-2-3-4 SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS. THE FIRST INVOLVES SIMPLY STOPPING THE CURSOR AS EACH ONE APPEARS IN ORDER - PRESSING THE WRONG ONE SENDS YOU BACK TO HAVING TO FIND A 1. IN THE SECOND, THE NUMBERS ARE ON SCREEN IN RANDOM ORDER, A CURSOR CYCLING THROUGH THEM - PRESS FIRE TO SWAP THE TWO NUMBERS CURRENTLY HIGHLIGHTED. IN THE THIRD, YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH TWO JUMBLED SETS AND MUST PUT ONE OF THEM IN ORDER, BY SWAPPING NUMBERS ACROSS THE TWO SETS. IN THE FOURTH, YOU MUST FORM THE SEQUENCE BY SWAPPING AN EVER-CHANGING NUMBER INTO THE RIGHT PLACE, BY PRESSING FIRE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.</desc>

	<desc>KENNY DALGLISH WAS A HUGELY SUCCESSFUL PLAYER FOR CELTIC, LIVERPOOL AND SCOTLAND, BEFORE BECOMING THE FIRST PERSON TO WIN THE ENGLISH LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP WHILE BOTH PLAYING AND MANAGING (FOR LIVERPOOL IN 1985, ALSO WINNING THE FA CUP THAT YEAR). THIS WAS HIS SECOND LICENSED GAME, AND IS A SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION GAME FEATURING SINGLE MATCHES PLAYED BETWEEN A TEAM IN RED AND A TEAM IN BLUE, EACH OF WHICH CAN BE ANY OF 9 SKILL LEVELS. MATCHES CAN BE VARIED BETWEEN 10 AND 90 MINUTES. THE BALL IS LOOSELY CONTROLLED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE KICK OFF SERIES, ALTHOUGH IT ISNT POSSIBLE TO PASS THE BALL A SHORT DISTANCE, SO AN ELEMENT OF HITTING AND HOPING COMES INTO PLAY, ESPECIALLY AS THE BALL CANT BE CURVED FAR. THE BALL BOUNCES QUITE HEAVILY, AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SHOOT ON TARGET FROM CLOSER THAN 30 YARDS OR SO.</desc>

VIEWED TOP-DOWN, THE CONTROLS INVOLVE TRAPPING THE BALL UNDER YOUR FOOT, GIVING YOU TIME TO PREPARE PASSES. RUNNING WITH THE BALL IS TRICKY AT FIRST, AS IT DOESN'T STICK TO YOUR FOOT THE WAY IT DID IN CONTEMPORARY FOOTBALL GAMES. COMPLEX MOVES SUCH AS OVERHEAD KICKS, BACK-HEELS AND LONG-RANGE THROUGH-BALL PASSES CAN BE COMPLETED WITH PRACTICE.</desc>

GAMEPLAY IS A CROSS BETWEEN THE BOARD-GAME CLUE AND THE PAPER-BASED LOGIC PUZZLES IN WHICH THE PLAYER MUST ELIMINATE CLUES IN SEQUENCE. TO SOLVE THE FORTHCOMING MURDER, YOU WILL HAVE TO SEARCH THE SUSPECTS' ROOMS AND CONFRONT THEM WITH THE EVIDENCE AND SET THE HOTEL'S SECURITY CAMERAS TO RECORD SECRET MEETINGS. 

BY QUESTIONING THE SUSPECTS AS TO WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE, ROOMS AND OBJECTS, THEY MAY REVEAL COMBINATIONS THEY KNOW WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN THE MURDER - PERHAPS IF IT INVOLVES THE GUN, THE KILLER WILL NOT BE LORD PETER FLIMSEY, FOR EXAMPLE.  HOWEVER, THERE'S A CATCH. IF HE ACCUSES THE WRONG SUSPECT, HE MIGHT BE THE ONE WHO'S KILLED UNTIL DEAD - THEY DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO FALSE ACCUSATION.</desc>

THE CROSSBOW EVENT INVOLVES MOVING A CROSSHAIR SO AS TO HIT ONE OF AN ARRAY OF ROTATING TARGETS. ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THIS YOU ARE READY FOR ARCHERY - THIS TIME YOU MUST HIT TARGETS WHICH MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, SO TIMING IS MORE IMPORTANT.

THE OTHER SIX INVOLVE ONE-ON-ONE COMBAT. THERE ARE TWO SWORD-FIGHTING BATTLES AGAINST DIFFERENT BACKDROPS; IN EACH OF THEM YOU MUST MAKE 10 HITS TO GET YOUR OPPONENT DOWN, AND DO THAT 10 TIMES TO WIN OVERALL. TIME YOUR JABS AND SHIELDS TO ACHIEVE THIS.

THE OTHER FOUR EVENTS FOLLOW THE SAME FORMULA, BUT WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WEAPONS. THE QUARTERMAST EVENT IS ON A LOG, ALTHOUGH THE ACTION IS STILL ONLY 2-DIMENSIONAL. BALL &amp;AMP; CHAIN, AXE AND PIKE BATTLES COMPLETE THE SET. ALL CAN BE PLAYED BY 2 HUMAN PLAYERS.</desc>

VIEWED IN 3D, YOU MOVE YOUR CHARACTER AROUND THE ROOMS, WHILE MOST OTHER ACTIONS ARE ACTIVATED USING A VERB-NOUN COMMAND SYSTEM. BY PRESSING THE FIRST LETTER OF THE FIRST WORD (OPEN, CLOSE, DIG AND SO ON) AND PRESSING ENTER ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT WORD, YOU CAN THEN CHOOSE THE SECOND WORD (OPTIONS ARE CONTEXT-SENSITIVE; FOR EXAMPLE 'DOOR' ONLY APPEARS IF YOU STAND NEAR ONE). 

PLENTY OF PUZZLES MUST BE SOLVED ALONG THE WAY. TWO ADVISERS ARE PRESENT, ONE GOOD AND ONE BAD, BUT EACH TIME YOU CALL FOR ADVICE ONLY ONE WILL ANSWER, AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE CLUE IS KOSHER. 

YOUR HEALTH IS INDICATED BY A CANDLE GRAPHIC, THE HIGHER THIS IS THE HEALTHIER YOU ARE. YOU START WITHOUT WEAPONRY OR SPELLS, BUT THESE CAN BE COLLECTED AND USED, INCLUDING A RAIN CLOUD TO FREEZE EVERYTHING, CASPER THE MAGIC KEY, AND A CAST-IRON ANVIL TO CRUSH ALL EVIL.</desc>

KNIGHT TYME IS THE THIRD GAME OF THE MAGIC KNIGHT SERIES. AS IN SPELLBOUND, THE PREVIOUS GAME, THE PLAYER INTERACTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE "WINDIMATION" SYSTEM: PRESSING A BUTTON BRINGS UP A WINDOW WITH A LIST OF COMMANDS (PICK UP/DROP/TAKE/GIVE AN OBJECT, EXAMINE, COMMAND A CHARACTER, READ SOMETHING, CAST A SPELL AND WEAR/UNWEAR OBJECT). THE PLAYER CAN SCROLL THROUGH THESE WITH THE MOVEMENT KEYS, AND EXECUTE THEM WITH THE SAME BUTTON USED BEFORE. SPACEFLIGHT IS PART OF THE GAMEPLAY AS THE SHIP MUST VISIT SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANETS. THE SPACESHIP HAS TO BE REFUELED, OTHERWISE THE CHARACTER WILL BE STUCK FOREVER IN SPACE. THERE ARE ROOMS THAT KILL THE KNIGHT INSTANTANEOUSLY. USUALLY THERE IS A PUZZLE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ROOMS THAT MUST BE SOLVED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THEM.</desc>

	<desc>YOU PLAY AS A TECHNO SCAVENGER IN THE YEAR 2049, EXPLORING THE KORONIS RIFT, IN ONE OF LUCASFILMS EARLIEST GAMES.

THE ANCIENTS ABANDONED THE PLANET, LEAVING BEHIND MANY DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS AND SHIPS, WHICH YOU CAN LOOT. SEND YOUR DROID TO RETRIEVE MODULES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY IS FOR. IT COULD BE BATTERIES, SHIELDS OR EVEN WEAPONS, TO HELP YOU FIGHT THE TRIGGER-HAPPY SAUCERS THAT WANT YOU DEAD.

THE GAME USES FRACTAL GRAPHICS, THE TERRAIN IS VAST AND DETAILED, AND THE STORY BEHIND IT IS QUITE COMPLEX, CONSIDERING THE TYPE OF GAME.</desc>

	<name>LABYRINTH</name>
	<desc>LABYRINTH: THE COMPUTER GAME IS A 1986 GRAPHIC ADVENTURE GAME DEVELOPED BY LUCASFILM GAMES AND PUBLISHED BY ACTIVISION. BASED ON THE FANTASY FILM LABYRINTH, IT TASKS THE PLAYER WITH NAVIGATING A MAZE WHILE SOLVING PUZZLES AND EVADING DANGERS. THE PLAYER'S GOAL IS TO FIND AND DEFEAT THE MAIN ANTAGONIST, JARETH, WITHIN 13 REAL-TIME HOURS. UNLIKE OTHER ADVENTURE GAMES OF THE PERIOD, LABYRINTH DOES NOT FEATURE A COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE. INSTEAD, THE PLAYER USES TWO SCROLLING "WORD WHEEL" MENUS ON THE SCREEN TO CONSTRUCT BASIC SENTENCES.

LABYRINTH WAS THE FIRST ADVENTURE GAME CREATED BY LUCASFILM. THE PROJECT WAS LED BY DESIGNER DAVID FOX, WHO INVENTED ITS WORD WHEELS TO AVOID THE TEXT PARSERS AND SYNTAX GUESSING TYPICAL OF TEXT-BASED ADVENTURE GAMES. EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT, THE TEAM COLLABORATED WITH AUTHOR DOUGLAS ADAMS IN A WEEK-LONG SERIES OF BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS, WHICH INSPIRED MUCH OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. LABYRINTH RECEIVED POSITIVE REVIEWS AND, IN THE UNITED STATES, WAS A BIGGER COMMERCIAL SUCCESS THAN THE FILM UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED. ITS DESIGN INFLUENCED LUCASFILM'S SUBSEQUENT ADVENTURE TITLE, THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED MANIAC MANSION.</desc>

	<name>THE LAST V8</name>
	<desc>SEVEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE WORLD WAR III, AND ONLY NOW DARE YOU LEAVE YOUR SHELTER IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE SURFACE WORLD. YOU DRIVE OUT IN YOUR SPECIALLY-EQUIPPED VEHICLE, THE LAST V8, ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS MORE HOSTILE THAN YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. YOUR TASK IS NOW (AS COMMENDED BY A DIGITISED VOICE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LEVEL) SIMPLY TO GET BACK TO THE BASE IN AS SHORT TIME AS POSSIBLE.

THE LAST V8 IS AN OVER-HEAD DRIVING GAME WHERE YOU MUST DRIVE THROUGH NARROW ROADS WITHOUT CRASHING INTO ANYTHING, AND WITH A STRICT DEADLINE FOR YOUR ARRIVAL AT THE BASE. THIS IS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE ONLY A NARROW STRIPE OF SCREEN SPACE TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE DRIVING; TWO THIRDS OF THE SCREEN IS DEDICATED TO INSTRUMENTS (SPEED READOUT, RADIATION LEVEL AND MISSION OBJECTIVES). THE STEERING METHOD IS NOT THE USUAL SPRINT ONE; INSTEAD YOU SIMPLY PULL THE JOYSTICK IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO, PULLING IT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN CASE YOU NEED TO DECELERATE.

ALL VERSIONS EXCEPT THE C128 VERSION HAVE TWO LEVELS. THE FIRST ONE TAKES PLACE IN AN ALMOST PASTORAL LANDSCAPE WHERE YOU MUST REACH THE SCIENTIFIC BASE, AFTER WHICH YOU MUST FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO YOUR OWN BASE WHILE AVOIDING RADIATION SOURCES. A DISTANCE READOUT WILL HELP YOU FIND THE CORRECT ROUTE.</desc>

YOU SEE THE HOUSE AND THE LITTLE PERSON LIVING IN IT, DOING ALL KINDS OF STUFF PEOPLE DO IN THEIR DAILY ROUTINE. HE'LL COOK, EAT, FEED HIS DOG, READ NEWSPAPERS, WATCH TV AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE WILL WRITE YOU A LETTER TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT HE FEELS OR WHAT THINGS HE MISSES. TO KEEP IT MORE GAMELIKE, YOU CAN "TALK" TO HIM IN FORM OF TYPING COMMANDS LIKE "FEED DOG". YOU CAN ALSO PLAY CARDS WITH HIM AND SEND HIM FOOD OR A PRESENT.
THERE IS NO AIM IN THIS GAME OTHER THAN TO INTERACT WITH YOUR LCP.</desc>

	<desc>AN ALIEN MENACE HAS ATTACKED THE WORLDS OF CIVILIZATION AND LAID WASTE TO THEIR PLANETS. HOWEVER BEFORE THE BEING CONQUERED, A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS HAS MANAGED TO CREATE ONE LAST WEAPON AND HIDDEN IT UNDERGROUND. THE NAME OF THE WEAPON IS MAG MAX AND ONLY IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEFEAT THE ALIEN INVADERS. MAG MAX HOWEVER IS INCOMPLETE AND FOR SECURITY REASONS, HIS COMPONENT PARTS ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE LAND. THROUGH THEIR COLLECTION, MAG MAX'S STRENGTH INCREASES.

MAG MAX IS A SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER GAME. AT THE BEGINNING, MAG MAX IS ONLY A TINY LITTLE FIGHTER CRAFT THAT CAN FIRE LOW-POWERED PROJECTILES. AS COMPONENT PIECES ARE FOUND; SUCH AS A HEAD, LEGS AND A LASER LANCE, MAG MAX'S OFFENSIVE POWER INCREASES. ACCESS TO THE UNDERWORLD CAN BE GRANTED THROUGH SMALL DARK CRATERS ON THE LANDSCAPE. ONCE IN THE UNDERWORLD, MAG MAX'S WEAPONS VARY SLIGHTLY AS DO THE ENEMIES (THERE ARE NO STATIONARY OBJECTS UNDERGROUND). ENEMY FIRE OR CONTACT ON EACH OF THE COMPONENTS WILL DESTROY THAT COMPONENT. FIRE ON THE MAIN FIGHTER WILL DESTROY MAG MAX. AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL AWAITS A BOSS CREATURE.</desc>

ALTERNATING WITH THIS, YOU ARE IN FRONT OF A ROW OF PIPES. HIT A GONG 3 TIMES TO SUMMON A GENIE, WHO WILL PLAY A SEQUENCE OF NOTES.

	<desc>IT IS A VERY STRANGE UNIVERSE REALLY - ISN´T IT? ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF PLANETS AND MOONS AND STARS AND COMETS SWIRLING ABOUT IN THE VASTNESS OF SPACE. IMAGINE WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE TO EXPLORE - TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO BOLDLY GOER HAD BOLDLY GONE BEFORE - UNLESS THEY HAPPENED TO LIVE THERE. 

LATEST RESEARCH FROM THE INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED RESEARCH (I.A.R.) INDICATED THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PLANETS WITH THINGS LIVING ON THEM. SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY INTELLIGENT LIKE US REALLY. OTHER OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY STUPID, LIKE WHELKS, FOR EXAMPLE. 

ANYWAY, TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT, YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE, BOLDLY SEEKING OUT STRANGE AND EXCITING NEW WORLDS. IF YOU FIND ANY, YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ARE QUITE CLEAR. 

BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!</desc>

YOU RUN THROUGH EACH OF THE 8 LEVELS, WHICH PRIMARILY SCROLL HORIZONTALLY, SHOOTING EVERYONE BEFORE THEY CAN SHOOT YOU. AT TIMES YOU WILL HAVE TO SHOOT TREES AND OTHER SCENERY TO PROGRESS. 

FINDING STRATEGIC PLACINGS IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY AS YOU CAN'T SHOOT WHILE ON WATER. MOST OF THE TIME YOU ARE ON FOOT, BUT AT TIMES YOU CAN HIJACK VEHICLES OF SHOT FOES. THERE ARE IMPROVED WEAPONS, SMART BOMBS AND ENERGY RECHARGES TO COLLECT. EACH OF THE 8 LEVELS ENDS WITH A LARGE VEHICLE REQUIRING MULTIPLE SHOTS TO DESTROY.</desc>

	<desc>IN THIS SPIN-OFF FROM A POPULAR TV COP SHOW OF THE 1980S, CROCKETT AND TUBBS ARE TRYING TO SMASH A DRUGS RING BOSSED BY MR. J. YOU HAVE TO START AT THE BOTTOM, INITIALLY BUSTING THE CASUAL DEALERS BEFORE REACHING THEIR SUPPLIERS, AND ULTIMATELY THE CASINO-DWELLING HONCHOS. 

THIS IS DONE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DRIVING AND SHOOTING, THROUGH AN OVERHEAD RENDITION OF MIAMI. WHEN CROOKS ARE STOPPED THEY WILL OFTEN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THEY CAN ONLY BE STOPPED BY SHOOTING THEM. 

WHEN YOU LEARN OF A MEETING, YOU CAN ENTER IT ON FOOT, EITHER TO GAIN EVIDENCE OR MAKE AN ARREST - BUT REMEMBER THAT A JOINT FULL OF CROOKS WILL NOT SIMPLY ALLOW YOU TO DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY. THIS IS ALL DONE AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, WITH A ONE-MINUTE PENALTY FOR CRASHING THE CAR.</desc>

YOU CAN PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER OR ANOTHER HUMAN; EITHER WAY, SELECT A SPECIALIST SUBJECT AND 2 TEAM-MATE GRAPHICS (ALL REPRESENTING WHITE PEOPLE). THE OVERALL STYLE AND PRESENTATION ARE VERY SIMILAR TO ELITE'S EARLIER A QUESTION OF SPORT LICENSE.

IN THE FIRST ROUND YOU SELECT ONE OF TWELVE RANDOM QUESTIONS FROM THE JUKEBOX, EACH OF WHICH HAS FOUR OPTIONS. A CORRECT ANSWER EARNS YOU TWO POINTS, WHILE AN INCORRECT ANSWER GIVES YOUR OPPONENT THE CHANCE TO STEAL FOR ONE POINT. IN ROUND 2 YOU GET THREE CLUES TO NAME A STAR - YOU GET THREE POINTS FOR GUESSING FROM ONE CLUE, TWO POINTS FROM TWO, AND ONE POINT IF YOU NEED ALL 3. IN ROUND THREE, CHOOSE AN EASY QUESTION (FROM YOUR CATEGORY) FOR ONE POINT, OR A HARD ONE (FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S) FOR TWO.

ROUND FOUR ASKS YOU TO GUESS THE YEAR THAT A SET OF EVENTS HAPPENED IN, WITH SCORING THE SAME AS ROUND 2. THEN COMES THE QUICKFIRE ROUND - ANSWER UP TO NINE QUESTIONS IN 45 SECONDS, WITH A 2-SECOND PENALTY FOR AN INCORRECT ANSWER. FINALLY, THE SIX REMAINING JUKEBOX PICTURES ARE REVEALED AND ANSWERED.</desc>

	<name>MIKIE</name>
	<desc>MIKIE PUTS YOU IN CHARGE OF MIKIE, A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO LIKES TO WIN HEARTS OF EVERY GIRL THAT HE CAN LAY HIS EYES ON. 

THERE ARE SEVERAL CLASSROOMS TO EXPLORE LIKE THE QUANTUM PHYSICS ROOM, LOCKER ROOM, CANTEEN, THE AEROBICS DANCING CLASS, AND THE PLAYGROUND. IN EACH CLASSROOM, MIKIE HAS TO COLLECT ALL THE HEARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN EACH CLASSROOM TO FORM A MESSAGE. IN ORDER TO COLLECT THESE HEARTS, MIKIE MUST STAND SOMEWHERE NEAR THEM AND SHOUT OUT. THERE ARE TWO TYPE OF HEARTS: SMALL  AND LARGE. MIKIE NEEDS TO SHOUT OUT ONLY ONCE TO COLLECT THE SMALL HEARTS, AND MULTIPLE TIMES TO COLLECT THE LARGE ONES. WHEN A MESSAGE IS FORMED, MIKIE CAN EXIT THE CLASSROOM THROUGH A DOOR MARKED OUT.

STOPPING HIM FROM COLLECTING THE HEARTS IS THE TEACHER, THE CHEF, AND THE JANITOR. THE TEACHER IS THE WORST ONE. WHEN HE IS UNABLE TO  CATCH YOU, HE WORKS UP A SWEAT, AND EVENTUALLY, THROWS HIS TEETH AT YOU. WHEN HIS TEETH HITS MIKIE, HE LOSES ONE OF HIS THREE LIVES. IN LATER CLASSROOMS, MIKIE CAN THROW STUFF AT HIS ENEMIES IN ORDER TO STUN THEM FOR SEVERAL SECONDS (FOR INSTANCE, THE BASKETBALLS IN THE LOCKER ROOM, AND THE CHICKENS IN THE CANTEEN). THE JANITOR ISN'T AS BAD BECAUSE HE WALKS MUCH SLOWER THAN THE OTHERS.

IN BETWEEN LEVELS, YOU HAVE TO ENTER THE NEXT CLASSROOM THROUGH A DOOR MARKED IN WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT, BUT YOU CAN DO AT LEAST TWO THINGS TO PASS TIME: STEAL SOME LUNCH, AND OPEN ONE OF THE UNMARKED DOORS TO RECEIVE A PUNCH, A KICK, OR THE CHANCE TO SEE A NAKED LADY WITH BREASTS. BEWARE THAT IF YOU TAKE TOO LONG IN THE HALLWAY AND DON'T TRAVEL BETWEEN FLOORS, A BUCKET SLIDES ACROSS THE SCREEN REAL FAST AND ATTEMPT TO SLIP YOU.

IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH AT THE GAME, YOU CAN ENTER A HIGH SCORE, AND IF YOU FAIL TO ENTER ANYTHING, THE GAME WILL ASSUME THAT YOU ARE CLINT EASTWOOD.</desc>

YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH UP TO 24 COLOURED AND SPOTTED (LIKE DICE) BLOCKS, ARRANGED IN COLUMNS OF UP TO 4. THE TASK IS TO ARRANGE THESE SO THAT THEY ARE LINED UP IN COLUMNS MATCHING THEIR NUMBER.

YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF A CROSSHAIR, WHICH CAN BE MOVED TO COVER FOUR BLOCKS. HOLDING FIRE WHILE PUSHING LEFT OR RIGHT AND HOVERING IT OVER A GROUP OF 4 WILL MOVE THE FOUR BLOCKS AROUND IN SEQUENCE. THINGS CAN GET HARDER WHEN THE LEVEL ARRANGEMENT RESULTS IN BLOCKS HAVING TO BE MOVED THROUGH SECTIONS WITH A COLUMN OF ONLY 2, OR WHEN SOME PARTS OF THE ARENA LACK COGS, MEANING THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE ON THOSE SECTIONS. LATER IN THE GAME YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK ON MULTIPLE FLOORS AT THE SAME TIME, SWITCHING BLOCKS BETWEEN THEM.</desc>

	<desc>A BOMB HAS BEEN SET BY TERRORISTS TO BLOW UP A SKY-SCRAPING HOTEL IN WHICH THE FBIS CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT IS LOCATED, AND YOU MUST DIFFUSE IT. 
REACHING THE ROOM ITSELF IS NO EASY TASK, AS THE HOTEL IS SPLIT INTO SEGMENTS OF 8 FLOORS, AND YOU CANT MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ONE WITHOUT THE EMERGENCY KEY, WHICH THE PORTER HAS HOLD OF  HE MUST BE LOCATED. EACH OF THESE HAS ONE EIGHTH OF THE SECRET STOP CODE, AND THESE MUST BE ENTERED IN ORDER TO FINALLY DIFFUSE THE BOMB. SECRETS CAN BE GLEANED FROM THE OPPOSING HIJACKERS, AND FROM THE BARMAN. IN SOME CASES FURNITURE CAN BE USED TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. 
THE WHOLE GAME IS SIMILAR TO IMPOSSIBLE MISSION, REQUIRING LOTS OF LOGIC, PUZZLE-SOLVING AND STRUCTURED THOUGHT.</desc>

CONTROLLING THE FAMILIARLY-NAMED RAINBOW WARRIOR IN THIS TOP-VIEW SHOOTER, YOU MUST FLY TO EACH OF THE 15 MUTANT-BREEDING ZONES, COLLECTING THEIR SELF-DESTRUCT PODS, AND TAKING ALL OF THESE TO THE CONTROL ROOM. YOU ARE ARMED WITH MISSILES, TORPEDOS AND A SHIELD, AND CAN USE ONE OF THESE AT A TIME. THE CONTROL ZONE IS HAZARDOUS, AND ANY CONTACT IS DESTRUCTIVE, BUT REACHING ITS TARGET WILL RECHARGE YOUR THREE LIVES; THUS, IT CAN BE WORTH DOING THIS BEFORE YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL 15 ZONES.

DUE TO THE DAMAGED CAUSED BY THE STORM, THE EPIC WAS FORCED TO LAND ON AN UNINHABITED PLANET TO MAKE URGENT REPAIRS. WHILE ON THE PLANET, THE SHIP'S CREW HAD NO IDEA THAT AN UNKNOWN VIRUS MADE ITS WAY ONTO THE SHIP. UPON RETURNING TO THE EPIC'S HOME BASE OF ALTONTRON, THE CREW BECAME AWARE THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN INFECTED BY THE ALIEN LIFE FORM.

THEY HAVE SENT AN ANDROID CALLED NEIL TO GET RID OF THE ALIENS. EACH ROOM OF THE SHIP CONTAINS NINE GREEN ALIENS THAT NEIL NEEDS TO DESTROY. AS WELL AS THESE ALIENS, THERE ARE ALSO ROBOTS THAT COME IN THE ROOM FROM TIME TO TIME. WHEN SHOT, THESE ROBOTS LEAVE BEHIND CELLS, WHICH GIVE NEIL EXTRA AMMUNITION, ALLOW HIM TO REPLENISH HIS AIR SUPPLY, OR USE A SMART BOMB WHICH KILLS ALL ALIENS IN THE ROOM. FINDING A TURBO LIFT ALLOWS NEIL TO TRAVEL BETWEEN FLOORS.</desc>

	<desc>CYRUS T. GROSS HAS BUILT THE TALOS ASTEROID AND DIRECTED IT TOWARDS EARTH. ONLY THE NEMESIS ORGANISATION'S MOBILE ATTACK DROID 471 CAN SAVE HUMANITY NOW. 

IN N.O.M.A.D., PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF THE MOBILE ATTACK DROID 471 AS IT VENTURES THROUGH THE CITY, IN THIS TOP-VIEW SHOOTER. PLAYERS BEGIN WITH FOUR LIVES. THE DROID MOVES WITH CONSIDERABLE INERTIA (ALTHOUGH SOME ROOMS DISABLE THIS), AND CONTROL INVOLVES USING LEFT AND RIGHT TO ROTATE IT, PUSHING FORWARD TO PROVIDE THRUST IN THE DIRECTION IT IS FACING, AND PUSHING BACKWARDS TO REVERSE. 

THE EARLY PART OF THE ROUTE IS LINEAR, BUT LATER ON THERE ARE JUNCTIONS TO PLAN AROUND. MOVING ENEMIES, SPAWNING POINTS AND WALL-MOUNTED GUNS ARE THE MAIN THREATS. THERE ARE MANY SWITCHES ALONG THE WALLS, WHICH OPEN THE SEALED DOORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE LEVELS, ALTHOUGH A SWITCH DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY OPERATE ON THE NEAREST DOOR. THE GAME FEATURES REGULAR CHECKPOINTS, WHICH WILL RESTORE THE DROID TO THAT POINT AFTER THE LOSE A LIFE. POINTS ARE AWARDED CONSTANTLY FOR SURVIVAL, AND FOR SHOOTING THE ENEMIES AND OTHER TARGETS.</desc>

FOR EXAMPLE, THE BLUE OR RED DOTS REPRESENT YOU, AND THE WHITE DOTS ARE THE MISSILE LAUNCHERS, WHILE THE "E" INDICATES THE EXIT.

YOUR MISSION AIN'T GOING TO BE EASY, AS YOU WILL COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH ENEMIES INCLUDING THE CANINE MUTTS, DAS LOF GANG, DR. SPIKE RUSH, JOE ROCKHEAD, KINKY PINKY, SGT. SKYHIGH, HQ POSSE, AND MR. BIG HIMSELF. YOU HAVE TWO WAYS YOU CAN DEAL WITH THEM: EITHER PUT A BULLET IN THEM OR MAKE ARRESTS. FURTHERMORE, THEY WILL TRY TO BLOW YOU UP THE MINUTE THEY SEE YOU. FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE ARMED WITH A SHOTGUN AND MISSILE LAUNCHER, BUT THESE BOTH HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION. IF YOUR BULLET COUNTER REACHES ONE, YOU CAN ONLY FIRE ONE BULLET AT A TIME, SO YOU NEED TO FIND SOME MORE. ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO WASTE ALL OF YOUR MISSILES: YOU MIGHT NEED THEM LATER WHEN YOU DEAL WITH LATER ENEMIES LIKE MR. BIG. YOU ARE ALSO BACKED UP BY A CHOPPER AND A MEAN SHINY STREET MACHINE.

MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, WHEN YOU BLOW UP ENEMIES, YOU CAN PICK UP SEVERAL ITEMS THAT THEY DROP, INCLUDING DRUGS, MONEY, AMMUNITION, MISSILE LAUNCHERS, AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY, SAFE CARDS.  EVEN IF YOU GOT THE SAFE CARD AND CAN PASS THE LEVEL, YOU CAN KEEP BLOWING UP ENEMIES TO SCORE MORE POINTS. ACCORDING TO THE GAME, THIS GAME IS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY, SO YOU WILL NOT GET EMPLOYED BY YOUR LOCAL DEA OFFICE. IS THIS WHAT THE DEA DOES EVERY DAY: GO ON RAMPAGES?</desc>

THE PLAYER(S) CONTROLLED ROBOT NINJAS, WHICH BATTLED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEVELS USING SHURIKEN AND KNIVES. AS THE NINJA'S TOOK DAMAGE THEIR CLASSIC NINJA GARB WAS TORN AWAY TO REVEAL ROBOTIC LIMBS, TORSO OR HEAD. WHEN THE DAMAGE REACHED CRITICAL THE NINJA ROBOT WOULD EXPLODE, SCATTERING MECHANICAL BODY PARTS.

AS WITH THE SALES CURVE'S LATER TITLE SWIV, THE NINJA WARRIORS USED THE COMPANY'S DYNAMIC LOADING SYSTEM TO LOAD SPRITES, SOUND AND BACKGROUND GRAPHICS FROM DISK ON THE FLY.</desc>

SECONDLY, IT'S ISOMETRICALLY-VIEWED (WITH MONOCHROME GRAPHICS, EVEN ON THE CAPABLE-OF-FAR-BETTER C64) AND FEATURES FULL OBJECT INTERACTION OF THE FILMATION STYLE - THIS IS TAKEN FURTHER HERE, AS THE PHYSICS OF THE OBJECTS ARE VARIED BY THEIR SHAPE AND CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

THERE ARE THREE STAGES TO COMPLETE. IN THE FIRST YOU PLAY JOHNATHAN HARKER, WHO MUST RETRIEVE SOME PAPERS (HE WORKS FOR AN ESTATE AGENT'S) AND ESCAPE THE CASTLE. THE SECOND LEVEL INTRODUCES JOHNATHAN'S WIFE LUCY, AND VAN HELSING, WITH PLAY SWITCHING BETWEEN THE THREE. LUCY'S ROLE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AS IT IS SHE WHO PURSUES THE VAMPIRE ITSELF, AND SHE TAKES ON THE TASK ALONE IN LEVEL 3.

FOOD MUST BE COLLECTED TO KEEP THE CHARACTERS' STRENGTH UP, AND CRUCIFIXES AND CANDLES CAN BE PICKED UP TO HELP MATTERS.</desc>

	<desc>THE GAME IS SET ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WITH SANTA (FATHER CHRISTMAS) RUSHING TO DELIVER PRESENTS TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.

AFTER THE PLAYER ENTERS HIS/HER NAME (WHICH IS USED LATER IN THE PERSONAL LETTER TO SANTA), THE FIRST LEVEL TAKES THE FORM OF A FLIP-SCREEN COLLECTING GAME WITH SANTA AT HOME GATHERING THE SCATTERED PIECES OF HIS SLEIGH. IF HE COLLIDES WITH ONE OF THE ELVES RUNNING AROUND, THE ITEM HE IS CARRYING IS LOST AND HAS TO BE FOUND AGAIN.

THE PLAYER CHOOSES SIX PRESENTS THEY WANT (COMPUTER, DOLL, BOOK, ETC.), WHICH ARE LISTED ON THEIR LETTER TO SANTA. SANTA THEN COLLECTS THE PRESENTS AS THEY FALL FROM THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

FINALLY SANTA CAN DELIVER THE PRESENTS, RIDING HIS SLEIGH OVER SEVERAL HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING CONTINENTS. THE PRESENTS ARE DROPPED WITH PARACHUTES AND SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE HOMES INDICATED BY ARROWS. CLOUDS AND AEROPLANES CAN KNOCK THEM OFF COURSE.</desc>

	<desc>OPERATION THUNDERBOLT IS THE EXCITING SEQUEL TO OPERATION WOLF. AN AIRLINER IS HIJACKED BY TERRORISTS EN-ROUTE FROM PARIS TO BOSTON, WHO THREATEN TO KILL ALL HOSTAGES ON BOARD IF THEIR MATES AREN'T RELEASED FROM JAIL. INSTEAD OF REACHING ITS DESTINATION, THE AIRLINER MAKES A LANDING IN KALUBYA, AFRICA, AND ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE HIDDEN IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ASKED THE HERO FROM OPERATION WOLF TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES, BUT ONLY THIS TIME, THE HERO BRINGS HIS FRIEND ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

THERE ARE EIGHT MISSIONS TO COMPLETE IN OPERATION THUNDERBOLT, AND EACH ONE HAS YOU SHOOTING DOWN SOLDIERS, CHOPPERS, AND TANKS. THE GAMEPLAY VARIES EVERY ONE OR TWO MISSIONS. IN SOME MISSIONS, YOU ARE DRIVING A JEEP OR CONTROLLING A BOAT, WHILE IN OTHERS, YOU ARE WALKING WHILE YOU'RE SHOOTING. YOU HAVE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AMMO, AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF ROCKET BOMBS, BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS STOCK UP BY SHOOTING DOWN CRATES FALLING FROM THE SKY, OR BY KILLING A CAT OR DOG THAT GET IN THE LINE OF FIRE. ALSO FROM CRATES, YOU CAN GET SPECIAL ITEMS LIKE BULLETPROOF VESTS, ROCKET BOMBS, AND DIFFERENT WEAPONS.

YOU ALSO HAVE A LIFE BAR TO WORRY ABOUT. IF YOU'RE SHOT AT BY SOLDIERS, OR IF ROCKET BOMBS OR GRENADES ARE THROWN AT YOU, YOU 'LL LOSE ENERGY, AND ONCE YOU'RE ENERGY IS DEPLETED,  YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR THREE LIVES. YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF ENERGY BY KILLING HOSTAGES ON PURPOSE,  AND YOU CAN'T EASILY AVOID KILLING THEM IF YOU DECIDE TO USE ROCKET BOMBS TO WIPE OUT ENEMIES. THE EIGHTH MISSION, THE MISSION THAT INVOLVES YOU FIGHTING TERRORISTS ON A PLANE,  PROVES TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS STANDS UP AND GETS IN THE LINE OF FIRE, AND YOU HAVE TO VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO USE ROCKET BOMBS.

THERE ARE TWO ENDINGS TO THIS GAME, AND WHICH ENDING YOU CAN WATCH WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF HOSTAGES YOU'VE SAVED, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOT THE PILOT INSTEAD OF THE MISSION EIGHT BOSS.</desc>

	<desc>YOU HAVE BEEN RECRUITED FOR OPERATION WOLF, A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO RESCUE PRISONERS FROM THE ENEMY. THROUGH A SERIES OF MISSIONS, YOU'LL ENGAGE A VARIETY OF ENEMIES, FROM SOLDIERS TO NINJAS, PATROL BOATS TO HELICOPTERS, AND MORE. CAN YOU CARRY THE DAY?

OPERATION WOLF IS AN ARCADE CONVERSION OF THE GAME BY TAITO. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A BITMAPPED "RAIL-SHOOTER", WHERE YOU BASICALLY HOLD THE GUN AND SHOOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MOVES, WHILE CONSERVING YOUR AMMO AND GRENADES. SHOOT AMMO/GRENADES AND HEALING ITEMS ON THE SCREEN TO "PICK THEM UP". YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE GUN CAN KILL EVERYTHING IF YOU HIT IT ENOUGH TIMES, BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GRENADE LAUNCHER FOR REALLY DEADLY TARGETS LIKE HELICOPTERS OR ARMORED CARS. YOU CAN COLLECT A MACHINE GUN WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT FASTER FOR A FEW SECONDS. 

YOU'LL BE PUMMELLED BY A LOT OF ENEMIES. SOME WILL BE SHOOTING, OTHERS WILL BE TOSSING GRENADES, KNIFES, AND MORE. SOME ARE ARMORED AND REQUIRES MORE THAN A FEW HITS, OTHERS DODGES. YOU CAN SHOOT GRENADES AND KNIFES OUT OF THE AIR IF YOU AIM WELL ENOUGH. THERE ARE ALSO CIVILIANS RUNNING AROUND WHICH CAN BE SHOT, BUT IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL. 

BOSSES APPEAR AT THE END OF SOME LEVELS, AND EACH HAS A SPECIFIC WEAKNESS YOU NEED TO EXPLOIT.</desc>

	<name>PARK PATROL</name>
	<desc>DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME A PARK RANGER? THIS GAME WILL TEST YOU TO SEE IF YOU'RE REALLY UP TO THE JOB. YOU PLAY A PARK RANGER, WHOSE JOB IS TO COLLECT TWELVE ITEMS SCATTERED AROUND THE PARK, SUCH AS SODA CANS, BOTTLES, AND BALLS. UNFORTUNATELY, GETTING THESE ITEMS IS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS, AS YOUR TASK GETS DIFFICULT BY SWIMMERS, SWAMPS, SNAKES, TURTLES, AND ANTS. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, YOUR ENERGY GETS DEPLETED QUICKLY, SO TO RESTORE IT, YOU CAN EITHER RETURN TO YOUR HUT, OR SNATCH FOOD OFF AN ANT'S BACK IN LATER LEVELS. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, SOME OF THE TURTLES WILL FOLLOW YOU INTO THE LAKE. IF THEY ENTER THE LAKE, YOU CAN RUN THEM OVER FOR 500 POINTS BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO JUMP BACK OUT AGAIN.

BESIDES COLLECTING ITEMS, YOU ALSO MUST RESCUE SWIMMERS THAT ARE ABOUT TO DROWN IN THE LAKE. FAIL TO RESCUE A SWIMMER IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, AND YOU'LL ALSO DROWN, AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID IF YOU BUMP INTO SNAKES. RATHER THAN COLLECTING ITEMS, YOU  CAN ALSO ROLL ON LOGS. DOING THIS WILL EARN YOU 5000 POINTS IF YOU MANAGE TO ROLL FOR A LONG TIME. THERE ARE FIVE LEVELS OF PARK PATROL TO COMPLETE, AND ONCE YOU COMPLETE ALL OF THEM, THE DIFFCULTY LEVEL GETS HIGHER AND THE GAME BECOMES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, THE TURTLES WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO KILL YOU, AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE SWIMMER TO RESCUE AT ONCE.

THIS GAME CAN HAVE TWO PLAYERS. PARK PATROL EVEN PROVIDES YOU WITH A MENU, IN WHICH YOU CAN ALTER THE NUMBER OF TURTLES, ANTS, SWAMPS, SWIMMERS, AND SNAKES IN EACH OF THE FIVE LEVELS. WITH THE MENU, YOU CAN HAVE NONE OF THESE IN EVERY LEVEL, BUT WHAT'S THE FUN OF COMPLETING A LEVEL WITHOUT ANY ENEMIES TO AVOID? ALSO, YOU CAN PLAY AS A BOY OR A GIRL.</desc>

TO WIN EACH MATCH YOU MUST GET TO 10 POINTS WITH A 2 POINT LEAD - IF THE SCORES REACH 10-9 THE GAME GOES ON UNTIL SOMEONE HAS A 2 POINT LEAD OR REACHES 15, IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO TENNIS. THERE ARE NINE SKILL LEVELS TO BEAT, WITH INCREASING ABILITIES AS THE GAME GOES ON. THE HUMAN PLAYER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SERVING FIRST, AND AS THE SERVE REVERSES EVERY FIVE POINTS, YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO HAVE MORE CHANCES TO SERVE THAN YOUR OPPONENT (REMEMBER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 10 AND 15 IN THE SCORING). THE POINTS SYSTEM REWARDS LONG RALLIES AND LARGE WINNING MARGINS, AS YOU GET POINTS FOR EACH HIT, FOR EACH POINT WON, AND FOR EACH POINT OF THE WINNING MARGIN.</desc>

	<desc>TAKE ON THE LIFE OF A BUCCANEER IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF CARIBBEAN PIRACY! THIS GAME LETS YOU CHOOSE FROM 6 DIFFERENT "AGES" (FOR EXAMPLE, "THE SILVER EMPIRE" FROM 1560-1600, "WAR FOR PROFIT" FROM 1640-1660, ETC.), ONE OF 4 NATIONALITIES (ENGLISH, FRENCH, DUTCH, SPANISH), 4 DIFFICULTY LEVELS, AND ONE OF 5 SPECIAL ABILITIES (SKILL AT FENCING, SKILL AT NAVIGATION, ETC.). NINE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHIPS WERE REPRESENTED. 

THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO RETIRE WITH AS MUCH GOLD AND LAND AS POSSIBLE, AS MANY RANKS/TITLES AS POSSIBLE (COLONEL, ADMIRAL, MARQUIS, DUKE), AND A WIFE. FINDING LONG LOST RELATIVES HELPS TOO. YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS BY PLUNDERING CITIES, CAPTURING AND SINKING ENEMY SHIPS, GETTING IN GOOD WITH GOVERNORS TO RECEIVE TITLES, LEARN NEWS OF "EVIL SPANIARDS" HOLDING YOUR RELATIVES, CAPTURING EVIL PIRATES, ETC.  

THE GAME IS EDUCATIONAL, AS YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT PIRACY THROUGH THE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED MANUAL. YOU'LL SMELL THE SEA SALT AS YOU PARTICIPATE IN WILD SWORD FIGHTS, DESPERATE SEA BATTLES, AND DARING ATTACKS BY LAND!</desc>

	<desc>IN THIS REMAKE OF THE ARCADE GAME POOYAN FROM THE EARLY '80S, YOU PLAY THE ROLE OF A PIG, PROTECTING ITS PIGLETS FROM WOLVES.  

THE FIRST SCREEN TAKES PLACE NEAR THE PIGS' HOME.  MRS. PIG RIDES UP AND DOWN IN A CABLE CAR, SHOOTING AT WOLVES, WHO ARE RIDING BALLOONS DOWNWARD, TOWARDS THE GROUND.  IF THE WOLVES LAND SAFELY ON THE GROUND, THEN THEY CAN CLIMB A LADDER, NEAR THE CABLE-CAR, AND CATCH MRS. PIG.  BUT IF SHE SHOOTS THEIR BALLOONS, THEY SPLAT ON THE GROUND INSTEAD.

THE WOLVES SHOOT ACORNS AT THE PIG.  BUT MRS. PIG HAS A FOOD BASED WEAPON TOO.  IF SHE GETS TO THE TOP, SHE CAN GET MEAT, TO TOSS AT THE WOLVES AND MAKE THEM JUMP OFF THEIR BALLOONS IN PURSUIT.  EACH WOLF TAKEN OUT THIS WAY IS WORTH BONUS POINTS (ON A DOUBLING SCHEME: 400, 800 1600...)

THE SECOND SCENE TAKES PLACE AT THE WOLVES LAIR.  HERE THE WOLVES HAVE REINFORCED BALLOONS--IT TAKES MULTIPLE HITS TO MAKE THEM FALL.  HERE THEY FLOAT UPWARDS TOWARD A BIG ROCK, WHICH THEY PUSH ON TOP OF MRS. PIG, WHEN SEVEN WOLVES ARE PRESENT.  ADDITIONALLY, AN ALPHA WOLF (WOLF LEADER) APPEARS AND SUMMONS WOLVES IN PACKS.</desc>

YOUR BUGGY HAS 2 GEARS, HIGH AND LOW. ONCE THE LIGHT GOES GREEN, JUST KEEP THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. YOULL NEED TO PLACE THIRD OR HIGHER TO CONTINUE TO THE NEXT STAGE. BE CAREFUL NOT TO BUMP INTO OTHER BUGGIES OR OBJECTS NEXT TO THE ROAD. WHILE YOURE BUGGY CAN TAKE A POUNDING, CRASHING WILL SLOW YOU DOWN.

THE GAMEPLAY IS SIMPLE: YOU'RE FACING A ROW OF BUILDINGS, A GANGSTER POPS UP AND YOU HAVE TO SHOOT HIM BEFORE THE ON-SCREEN TIMER GOES EMPTY AND HE SHOOTS YOU FIRST. YOU CAN HIDE UNTIL THE TIMER RESTARTS BUT THIS IS LIMITED TOO.

AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH EACH STAGE, THE GAME WILL BECOME FASTER, AND ENEMIES WILL BECOME HARDER TO FIND AND TO HIT.
OF COURSE, YOUR GOAL IS TO REACH THE END OF THE GAME WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SCORE.</desc>

	<desc>SEQUEL TO ATHENA, THE 2D SIDE-SCROLLER WHICH STARRED A STYLIZED MANGA VERSION OF THE GREEK GODDESS ATHENA AS SHE SET OUT TO FIND ADVENTURE IN THE MORTAL WORLD.

THIS GAME FEATURES ATHENA ASAMIYA, A DESCENDANT OF PRINCESS ATHENA, WHO USES HER NEW PSYCHIC POWERS (HENCE THE GAME'S TITLE, PSYCHO SOLDIER) TO CLEAR A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD OF ITS MUTANT INHABITANTS WITH THE HELP OF HER FRIEND KENSU, THUS ALLOWING SIMULTANEOUS TWO PLAYERS GAMEPLAY.

THE GAMEPLAY CONSISTS OF THE USUAL RUN AND JUMP FARE TYPICAL OF THE GENRE WITH THE ADDED FEATURE OF A CONSTANTLY SCROLLING BACKGROUND, WHICH, ADDED TO THE MANY "OPTION"-STYLE POWER-UPS AND ATHENA'S OWN PSYCHIC BLASTS MAKE THE GAME A STRANGE SHOOTER/PLATFORMER HYBRID.</desc>

EACH STAGE IS FILLED WITH THE TYPICAL HAZARDS OF A TRADITIONAL PLAY, LIKE CROCODILES, CUSTARD PIES AND ROTTEN TOMATOES, AS WELL AS THE PITS THAT MUST BE CROSSED VIA MOVING PLATFORMS. YOU'LL SOMETIMES HAVE THE CHANCE TO CATCH A SAUSAGE FLYING AROUND IN THE AIR AS YOU MOVE ALONG.

EVEN THOUGH IT IS A RATHER EARLY GAME, THE SPECTRUM VERSION FEATURES SOME INTERESTING SPEECH SAMPLES USING A TECHNIQUE THAT WAS VERY UNCOMMON AT THAT TIME.</desc>

	<path>./Puzznic (Europe).zip</path>
	<name>PUZZNIC</name>
	<desc>THE CHALLENGE IN EACH LEVEL OF PUZZNIC IS TO MANEUVRE A SELECTION OF BLOCKS INTO PLACE SO AS TO CLEAR THEM ALL, BY MAKING THEM MAKE CONTACT WITH BLOCKS OF THE SAME DESIGN. YOU CONTROL A CROSS-HAIR, WHICH CAN MOVE A BLOCK LEFT OR RIGHT, WHICH CAN CAUSE IT TO FALL IF THERE IS NO BLOCK UNDER THE SPACE IT WOULD OCCUPY.

THERE ARE MANY COMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF SOLVING THE LEVELS. MOVING PLATFORMS MEANING THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE A BLOCK AT A PARTICULAR TIME, OR IN PARTICULAR ORDER, TO PREVENT THEM BEING BLOCKADED. IN SOME SITUATIONS THERE ARE AN ODD NUMBER OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF BLOCK - SOLVING THESE REQUIRES POSITIONING TWO OF THE BLOCKS ONE SPACE APART, SUCH THAT A MOVE WILL RESULT IN A PIECE MAKING CONTACT WITH 2 OTHERS, AND IMMEDIATELY REMOVING ALL 3. YOU WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER BLOCKS POSITIONED ON PLATFORMS SUSPENDED IN SPACE AND GAPS IN LEVEL ARRANGEMENTS MEANING THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLOCKS MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE A CERTAIN MOVE POSSIBLE (BY FORMING A STACK, FOR EXAMPLE)

THE GAME STRUCTURE IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL, AS AFTER YOU COMPLETE EACH BATCH OF FOUR LEVELS YOU GET A CHOICE OF 2 SETS OF LEVELS - YOU ARE PROGRESSING THROUGH AN EXPANDING MATRIX OF LEVELS, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE 2 SETS ON LEVEL 2, 3 ON LEVEL 3, 4 ON LEVEL 4, AND SO ON. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 220 SCREENS IN THE GAME. EACH SCREEN IS PLAYED AGAINST A TIME LIMIT, AND LOSING A LEVEL (EITHER BY RUNNING OUT OF TIME, OR BY MAKING A POOR MOVE AND LEAVING AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION) LOSES ONE OF YOUR 3 LIVES.</desc>

THE GAME HAS THE PLAYER CONTROLLING A HELICOPTER WHICH IS ON A MISSION TO DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. THE ONLY ALLY IS THE CARRIER, WHICH IS WHERE THE PLAYER BEGINS AT EACH LEVEL AND MAY RETURN TO FOR REPAIR AND PICK UP BOMBS, AS LONG AS THE PLAYER MANAGES TO PROTECT IT FROM BEING DESTROYED. THE MAIN GOAL IN EACH LEVEL IS TO DESTROY A FACTORY, WHICH REQUIRES A STEADY INCREASING AMOUNT OF BOMBS.

THIS IS DONE IN A MULTI-STAGE ACTION GAME WITH SOME SIMILARITIES TO THE SAME DEVELOPER'S BEACH HEAD. ALL THE MINI-GAMES MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT ON THE BOMB IS EXPIRED.

THE FIRST THING YOU WILL SEE IS A MISSILE BEING LAUNCHED; THE GAME THEN TAKES YOU TO YOUR HANGAR, FROM WHICH YOU MUST QUICKLY LAUNCH AS MANY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE, A TASK MADE DIFFICULT BY THE LIMITED GRAVITY. YOU MUST THEN FLY IT INTO SOVIET AIRSPACE IN A SIDE-VIEW SHOOT 'EM UP SECTION, IN WHICH STAYING LOW KEEPS YOU SAFE FROM RADARS, AND QUICK REACTIONS SEE YOU SHOOT ENEMY FIGHTERS AND AVOID TREES.

THE NEXT SCENE TAKES PLACE ON A SINGLE-SCREEN VIEW, WITH FIVE WINDOWS TO SHOOT THROUGH, AND ENEMIES AIMING AT YOU TO BE AVOIDED. YOU THEN REACH THE BASE, AND MUST SHOOT OUT APPROACHING ENEMIES. FINALLY, YOU MUST USE DISCS ONTO A WALL, SUCH THAT THEY REBOUND TO HIT MAINTENANCE ROBOTS, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF CAUSING THE BASE TO OVERHEAT, THE SOVIET ATTACK TO BE THWARTED, AND THE US TO BE SAVED.</desc>

COLONEL TRAUTMAN HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED BY THE SOVIETS, AND YOU'VE GONE IN THERE TO RESCUING HIM. DOING SO IS A THREE-PART OPERATION APPROXIMATELY FOLLOWING THE PLOT OF THE FILM.

IN THE FIRST PART, YOU EXPLORE THE BUILDING TRAUTMAN COULD BE IN, THROUGH A TOP-DOWN VIEW OF THE BUILDING. IT IS HEAVILY PROTECTED BY INFRA-RED SECURITY BEAMS, WHICH WHEN ACTIVATED UNLEADSH THE ENEMIES. THE LOCATIONS OF THE BEAMS ARE ONLY APPARENT IF YOU COLLECT THE SPECIAL GOGGLES. OTHER HAZARDS INCLUDE MINES, TRAPDOORS AND BOOBY-TRAPPED DOORS, BUT THERE ARE ENHANCED WEAPONS TO COLLECT.

SECTION TWO IS IDENTICAL TO THE FIRST, EXCEPT THAT IT IS LOCATED OUTSIDE, THE ENEMY ARE ONTO YOU FROM THE START, AND THERE ARE NO TRAPS. THE FINAL SECTION CHANGES TO AN OPERATION WOLF-STYLE SHOOT 'EM UP, WITH A HORDE OF TANKS, FOOT SOLDIERS AND HELICOPTERS TO FACE. YOUR GUN CAN JAM, WHICH ADDS TO THE CHALLENGE OF FINALLY GETTING OUT ALIVE.</desc>

	<desc>NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ATARI GAMES' RAMPART, RAMPARTS IS IN FACT A CLONE OF BALLY MIDWAYS' RAMPAGE, BUT WITH A MEDIEVAL THEME, AND PLAYERS ARE GIANT KNIGHTS INSTEAD OF MONSTERS. THE GAME IS FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND EACH HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER IN A FIVE-CHARACTER NAME BEFORE PLAY BEGINS, WHICH WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE DISPLAYED NEXT TO INDIVIDUAL SCORES DURING PLAY. 

THE GAME TAKES PLACE ON A SINGLE SCREEN, WHERE THE PLAYER(S) CAN MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT ON ONE FOREGROUND PLANE, AND THE OBJECT IS TO DESTROY A CASTLE, EACH PHASE, BY SCALING AND PUNCHING THE INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS UNTIL EACH, AND ALL COLLAPSES. BUILDINGS WILL OFTEN OVERLAP, REQUIRING SOME TO BE TAKEN DOWN BEFORE OTHERS. PLAYERS WILL BE HARASSED BY WITCHES, GOBLINS, ARCHERS AND THE LIKE. 

THE BACK STORY CONCERNS TWO KNIGHTS, SIR GRISWOLD AND SIR LARKIN, WHO HAVE HAD A CURSE SET UPON THEM TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO GIANTS BY THE EVIL ONE, AND THEY MUST QUEST FOR THE FIEND, SO THAT THEY MAY BE RESTORED TO MERE MORTALS.</desc>

	<name>RANARAMA</name>
	<desc>THE PURPOSE OF APPRENTICE COURSES IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN A TRADE GRADUALLY, WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF OR YOUR EMPLOYERS AT RISK. UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY EXPLAINED THIS TO WIZARDS APPRENTICE MERVYN, BEFORE HE TRIED TO CAST A SPELL TO MAKE HIM IRRESISTIBLE TO FEMALES, AS THE SPELL MISFIRED, AND MADE HIM ATTRACTIVE ONLY TO FEMALE FROGS. HOWEVER, HIS DUNGEON WAS SOON INVADED, AND MERVYN WAS NOT KILLED, AS HE APPEARED TO BE A HUMBLE FROG.

VIEWED FROM ABOVE, THE AIM IS TO KILL ALL 96 OF THE WIZARDS WHO HAVE INVADED THE DUNGEON, WHICH IS SPLIT INTO 8 LEVELS, EACH MADE UP OF 16 SCREENS AND AT LEAST 50 ROOMS. TO SEE WHATS IN A ROOM HE HAS TO ENTER IT, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE SWITCHBLADE GAMES.

THE GAMES RATHER ESOTERIC TITLE COMES FROM THE WAY YOU OBTAIN SPELLS TO UPGRADE THE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER YOU HAVE (POWER, OFFENCE, DEFENCE AND EFFECT). WHEN YOU MEET A WARLOCK YOU ENTER A MINI GAME IN WHICH THE LETTERS RANARAMA ARE IN RANDOM ORDER, AND BY SWAPPING PAIRS OF LETTERS IN SEQUENCE YOU MUST FORM THE FULL WORD IN AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE. THIS SYSTEM OF HAVING A SUB-GAME FOR COLLECTING UPGRADES IS SIMILAR TO THE GRAPPLING CONCEPT IN PARADROID.

THIS EARNS UP TO FOUR OF THE RUNES (MYSTICISM, WITCHCRAFT, MAGECRAFT AND RUNECRAFT), EACH OF WHICH CAN BE USED ON ONE OF THE FOUR TYPES OF POWER. THE MAGECRAFT OFFENSIVE USE IS A FIREBALL, DEFENCE FOR RUNECRAFT MAKES YOU INVISIBLE TO ENEMIES, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECT FOR WITCHCRAFT ALLOWS YOU TO JUMP THROUGH SPACE. LOSE A LIFE AND YOU LOSE ALL THESE POWERS, AND LOSING ANOTHER LIFE MEANS ITS GAME OVER.</desc>

DISGUISED AS A MERCHANT, YOU WILL FLY YOUR SHIP, THE CAYDIA, TO THREE DIFFERENT COLONY PLANETS -- TROPOS, HALMURIS, AND ARCADION -- TO RENDEZVOUS WITH UNDERGROUND FREEDOM FIGHTERS AND GATHER THE INTELLIGENCE YOU REQUIRE TO DESTROY THE CENTRAL COMPUTER OF THE ARCADIAN HIVEMIND, LIBERATING HUMANITY!

AN ADAPTATION OF ROBIN WATERFIELD'S FIGHTING FANTASY GAMEBOOK #18, PUBLISHED THE PREVIOUS YEAR, THIS COMPUTER GAME VERSION REJECTS THE CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE GAMEPLAY DESIGN OF THE BOOK IN FAVOUR OF A MORE OPEN-ENDED TEXT ADVENTURE MODEL, ALBEIT ONE WITH A RESTRICTIVE TEXT PARSER.  MOST ELEMENTS OF THE TRADEMARK FIGHTING FANTASY RPG SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE RANDOMNESS OF EVEN SIMULATED DIE-ROLLS, HAVE BEEN STREAMLINED OUT, LEAVING ONLY METRICS FOR DAMAGE TAKEN AND HUNGER (HITHERTO UNTRACKED IN THE BOOKS.)  CARRYING LIMITS, WHILE ATYPICAL IN FF GAMEBOOKS, ARE ENFORCED HERE AS IN THE ORIGINAL BOOK.

A FURTHER NEW DYNAMIC INCLUDES THE STRICT TIMETABLE OF THE SPACE TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWERS -- YOU NEED TO HAVE WRAPPED UP YOUR BUSINESS PLANETSIDE BEFORE YOUR LAUNCH WINDOW COMES UP, OTHERWISE YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK.  IN KEEPING WITH THE GAME'S SCI-FI SETTING (IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN FLAVOURS), YOU WILL FIND EXTENSIVE USE OF OBJECTS SUCH AS YOUR LIMCOM, NUTRITIOUS HCAPS (TASTY LIKE DEAD ZORKONS, NUM NUM!), AND THE INDISPENSABLE LITE-KUBE.  COMBAT HAS BEEN LARGELY PHASED OUT IN FAVOUR OF AN EXTENSION OF THE GAMEBOOK'S ESPIONAGE THEME OF CIPHERS AND PASSWORDS, MAGIC WORDS WITH THE POWER OF PLOT ADVANCEMENT.

A VERSION OF THIS GAME ALSO CAME OUT FOR THE BBC MICRO.</desc>

YOUR CAR HAS A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUEL, HOWEVER MORE CAN BE PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY BY CROSSING THE HALFWAY POINT OF A LEVEL, OR BY COLLECTING THE RED AND GREEN FUEL SPHERES THAT APPEAR IN THE ROAD OR AFTER DESTROYING CERTAIN ENEMIES.  ON MANY LEVELS COLLECTING FUEL IS CRITICAL OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THE FINISH LINE.</desc>

YOU PLAY THE ROAD RUNNER. YOU MUST RUN ALONG THE ROAD, AVOIDING TRUCKS, LANDMINES, FALLING ROCKS, ETC. AND ALSO NOT GET CAUGHT BY WILE E. COYOTE. YOU MUST ALSO EAT BIRDSEED ALONG THE WAY OR YOU WILL BECOME FAINT AND WILE E. WILL CATCH YOU.

YOU CAN GET POINTS FOR EATING BIRDSEED AND MAKING WILE E. GET HIT BY TRUCKS, FALLING ROCKS, ETC.

THE AMSTRAD CPC, COMMODORE 64 AND ZX SPECTRUM VERSIONS ARE ONE PLAYER ONLY. THE ATARI 2600 VERSION IS ONE OR TWO PLAYER, ALTERNATING. THE ATARI 2600 VERSION ALSO HAS ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THE BIRDSEED BUT YOU CAN FOR THE POINTS. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO PROGRAMMING CONSTRAINTS ON THE ATARI 2600.</desc>

IN THE FIRST ROAD RUNNER MUST PECK AS MUCH SEED FROM THE GROUND OF A SINGLE SCREEN AS HE CAN, WHILE AVOIDING THE MYRIAD TRAPS AND DANGERS WILE E. COYOTE THROWS AT HIM FROM THE SKY. THE MORE SEED YOU CAN PECK, THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES WILL BE IN TAKE 2.  THIS INVOLVES RUNNING AWAY FROM WILE E, JUMPING THE TRAPS HE HAS LAID AND FINALLY REACHING THE SAFETY OF A BIG DROP, WHICH YOU WILL CLEAR AND WATCH WILE E.

THERE ARE 40 SCREENS TO CLEAR, ALL FULL OF BADDIES, WHO ARE DISPOSED OF BY GRABBING THEM WITH A STICK, AND FLIPPING THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO INFLICT DAMAGE. THE HITS NEEDN'T ALL BE INFLICTED AT THE SAME TIME, AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO RELEASE THEM TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE WAY.

WHEN KILLED, EACH BAD GUY RELEASES SOME KIND OF EXTRA, RANGING FROM POINTS BONUSES TO VARIOUS DEVICES WHICH CAN BE USED TO KILL OTHER ENEMIES.

EACH LEVEL ALSO CONTAINS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FRUIT. IF YOU CAN COLLECT ALL OF THIS (WITH SOME BAD GUYS STILL ALIVE - YOU MOVE ON IMMEDIATELY ONCE THEY'RE GONE) YOU ENTER A BONUS GAME, IN WHICH EACH ENEMY'S DEATH RESULTS IN ONE OF THE LETTERS E,X,T,R AND A BEING RELEASED - COLLECT THEM ALL FOR AN INVALUABLE EXTRA LIFE.

IN THE GAME BOY VERSION THE DIFFICULTY LIES SLIGHTLY LOWER BECAUSE THE PLAYER CAN USE HIS WAND EVEN WHEN CLIMBING LADDERS.</desc>

	<name>R-TYPE</name>
	<desc>R-TYPE IS A SIDE SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP BEST KNOWN FOR ITS EXTREMELY TOUGH AND STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY.  YOU CONTROL THE R-9 SPACESHIP AS IT LAUNCHES A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEL THE EVIL BYDO EMPIRE.

THE R-9 COMES EQUIPPED AS STANDARD WITH A SMALL GUN WHICH CAN ONLY TAKE DOWN THE SMALLEST OF ENEMIES WITHOUT FIRING SEVERAL SHOTS. BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON, IT CAN BE LOADED UP SO AS TO RELEASE A LARGE BURST OF ENERGY, ELIMINATING ALL BUT THE STRONGEST ENEMIES IN ITS PATH. FROM TIME TO TIME, PODS WILL COME FLYING IN YOUR DIRECTION. UPON BEING SHOT, THEY RELEASE AN UPGRADE. THE FIRST ONE WILL INVARIABLY BE THE ONE CALLED "THE FORCE", WHICH IS A WEAPONS POD THAT CLINGS EITHER TO THE FRONT OR THE BACK OF YOUR SHIP, ABSORBING ANY ENEMY BULLETS OR ACTING AS A BUMPER WITH WHICH YOU CAN FLY HEAD-ON INTO THEM. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON BY FIRING IT AND PULLING IT BACK IN. MASTERING THE FORCE IS VITAL TO SURVIVING IN R-TYPE, SINCE IT MUST BE USED BOTH AS PROTECTION AGAINST BULLET CLUSTERS, AS A REMOTE CONTROLLED CANNON, AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE SCREEN FROM OBSTACLES. OTHER UPGRADES GIVE YOU TARGET-SEEKING MISSILES OR A BIGGER MAIN GUN. DIFFERENT GUN TYPES, DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR COLOUR, SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. THE BLUE ONE SENDS LASER BEAMS BOUNCING ACROSS THE SCREEN (GOOD FOR TUNNELS), THE RED ONE FIRES STRAIGHT AHEAD, AND THE YELLOW ONE FOLLOWS ANY WALLS IT MAY ENCOUNTER (GOOD FOR ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS).

THE STAGES OF R-TYPE ARE MADE IN AN ORGANIC STYLE, CERTAINLY INSPIRED BY H. R. GIGER'S ARTWORK FOR THE ALIEN MOVIES. WHEN IT CAME OUT, IT WAS CONSIDERED TREND-SETTING SINCE IT BROKE OFF FROM THE STEREOTYPICAL SCI-FI MOULD OF OTHER SHOOT'EM'UPS. IN PART, THE LEVELS THEMSELVES ARE YOUR ENEMY, WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FOURTH, WHERE SPIDER-LIKE CREATURES WEAVE WEBS THAT COVER THE SCREEN AND BLOCK YOUR PATH, OR LEVELS WITH INTRICATE TUNNEL SYSTEMS. STILL, THE LEVELS ARE BEST HANDLED WITH A COMBINATION OF STRATEGY AND REFLEXES, WITHOUT THE MEMORISATION THAT IS REQUIRED OF R-TYPE'S CONTEMPORARY RIVAL, GRADIUS.</desc>

SEYMOUR GOES TO HOLLYWOOD IS A PLATFORM ADVENTURE, ANOTHER DIZZY CLONE, THIS TIME REPLACING THE EGG CHARACTER WITH AN AMORPHOUS BLOB OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN. LIKE IN THE DIZZY GAMES, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO COLLECT EVERYTHING THAT ISN'T NAILED DOWN (USING THE FIRE BUTTON) TO SOLVE PUZZLES. IN THE UPPER LEFT PORTION OF THE SCREEN SITS AN INVENTORY WITH THREE SLOTS AND BESIDES THAT THE SCORE POINTS AND THE ENERGY BAR. SEYMOUR LOSES ENERGY WHEN TOUCHING DANGEROUS OBJECTS AND HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS. WHEN THE BAR GETS EMPTY, SEYMOUR TRANSFORMS INTO A PILE OF BONES AND THE PLAYER LOSES ONE LIFE. THE GAME STARTS WITH THREE LIVES (SHOWN AS CLACK BOARDS UNDER THE ENERGY BAR) AND NO WAY OF SAVING PROGRESS.</desc>

	<desc>SHADOW DANCER IS A ONE-PLAYER GAME IN WHICH YOU CONTROL SHINOBI. WITH THE HELP OF YOUR DOG, YOU MUST KILL YOUR ENEMIES WHILE YOU VENTURE THROUGH LOCATIONS SUCH AS AIRPORTS, RAILROADS, WATERFALLS, SEWERS, AND MORE.  FURTHERMORE, YOU MUST FIND AND DISARM SEVERAL BOMBS ALONG THE WAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE EACH. YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF USING MAGIC AGAINST ENEMIES, WHICH MAY CONSIST OF TORNADOES OR FIREBALLS.

THERE ARE FIVE MISSIONS YOU MUST COMPLETE; AND EACH ONE HAS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES SUCH AS OBSTRUCTING THE ENEMIES DEADLY MISSION, DISRUPTING THE ENEMY'S SUPPLY ROUTE, RAIDING THE ENEMY'S INDUSTRIAL UNITS, ATTACKING THE ENEMY'S UNDERGROUND FORCES, AND LIBERATING AND SECURING THE SHUTTLE'S BASE. EACH MISSION CONSISTS OF THREE STAGES AND THERE IS A BOSS ON EACH OF THE MISSION'S FINAL STAGES. 

WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE DOG, YOU SAY? WELL, IF YOU TELL IT TO, THE DOG WILL MAUL ENEMIES (PROVIDED THAT THE DOG BARKS AT THEM WHEN YOU FACE THEM) AND DISTRACT THEM LONG ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN SHOOT AT THEM. REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE A LIMITED TIME TO DO THIS, AS THE ENEMY WILL EVENTUALLY KICK THE DOG OFF HIM. THIS CAUSES THE DOG TO YELP AND SHRINK, MAKING HIM POWERLESS AGAINST THEM.</desc>

	<desc>GENERAL ZOFF IS HOLDING AMBASSADOR KRYXIX CAPTIVE IN HIS SPACESHIP. PLANS FOR A NEW TYPE OF SPACESHIP ARE HIDDEN IN A MICRO-DISC EMBEDDED IN THE AMBASSADOR'S SPINE. IF ZOFF HAD THE PLANS, THE EMPIRE WOULD BE IN GREAT DANGER, AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HIS INQUISITORS WILL DISCOVER THEM. THE EMPEROR HAS ASSEMBLED THE SO-CALLED "ENIGMA TEAM", A GROUP OF SIX RECKLESS MERCENARIES, TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION.

PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF ALL SIX MERCENARIES AND HAVE ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES TO RESCUE AMBASSADOR KRYXIX AND CAPTURE GENERAL ZOFF. ALL SIX CHARACTERS HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES. SYYLK IS AN INSECTOID AND A STRONG FIGHTER, ZARK MONTOR, THE TEAM LEADER, IS AN EXPERT IN UNARMED COMBAT AND THE ONLY TRANSLATOR OF THE GROUP, SERVINA MARIS IS THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO CAN PICK LOCKS, TORIK IS AN AVIAN WITH THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF EXPLOSIVES, MAUL IS A SLOW COMBAT DROID AND MANTO IS A WEAK DROID, BUT THE ONLY TEAM MEMBER THAT CAN OPERATE THE TRANSPORTER THAT IS VITAL FOR THE MISSION'S SUCCESS.

CONTROLS ARE COMPLETELY ICON BASED AND THE SCREEN IS DIVIDED INTO SIX SECTIONS. THE UPPER SCREEN SECTION IS CALLED THE MISSION COMMAND SCREEN AND DISPLAYS WHICH CHARACTER IS ACTIVE, THE ACTIVE CHARACTER'S LOCATION AND THE STATUS OF ALL CHARACTERS: WHETHER THEY ARE MOVING, ENGAGED IN COMBAT, WEAK OR DYING OR PERFORMING CERTAIN ACTION SUCH AS PICKING LOCKS. THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN CHANGES DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND SHOWS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND ALL SELECTABLE ACTIONS.

FROM THE MAIN GAME SCREEN (ENIGMA TEAM SCREEN) PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THE SIX CHARACTERS AND ACCESS FOUR SUB-SCREENS:

CHARACTER STATUS SCREEN:
SHOWS A CHARACTER'S SPEED, STRENGTH, STAMINA (HEALTH) AND CARRIED WEIGHT.

OBJECT SCREEN:
SHOWS ALL OBJECTS PRESENT AT A LOCATION AS WELL AS ALL OBJECTS CARRIED BY THE SELECTED CHARACTER. IT CAN BE USED TO DROP OR PICK UP ITEMS, EQUIP WEAPONS AND ITEMS OR USE SPECIAL ITEMS.

MOVEMENT SCREEN:
HERE, THE ACTIVE CHARACTER CAN BE MOVED BY CLICKING ON ARROWS THAT SHOW POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR A CHARACTER TO MOVE.

BATTLE SCREEN:
DURING BATTLES, CHARACTERS CAN SCAN THE LOCATION TO COUNT AND IDENTIFY THEIR ENEMIES, MOVE, ATTACK WITH THEIR EQUIPPED WEAPON, DEFEND OR RETREAT.</desc>

	<desc>WAIT, YOU SAY, WASN'T THIS AN INFOCOM TITLE? ACTUALLY, THIS ONE CAME OUT FIRST ON THE BUDGET PUBLISHER MASTERTRONIC'S CATALOG. IT'S A VASTLY DIFFERENT GAME THAN THE INFOCOM ONE - YOU WANDER AROUND AS ONE OF A NUMBER OF CHARACTERS TRYING TO BUILD UP YOUR RAPPORT WITH THE PEOPLE, DOING BATTLE AND WORKING YOUR WAY UP TO BECOMING A SHOGUN. AN OBSCURE TITLE THAT I ALWAYS LOVED - AND THE VERY ODD GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY, ON A 2D SURFACE  WHERE YOU'RE ALWAYS FLYING EVERYWHERE, WERE SO STRANGE, BUT IN THE END THAT MADE IT A MEMORABLE GAME.</desc>

	<name>SHORT CIRCUIT</name>
	<desc>IN THIS ADAPTATION OF THE MOVIE OF THE SAME NAME, YOU TAKE THE ROLE OF ROBOT NUMBER 5. HAVING RECENTLY BECOME SELF-AWARE, NUMBER 5 HAS TO ESCAPE FROM THE LABORATORY. TO DO SO, HE HAS TO FIND SEVERAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE UPGRADES THAT GIVE HIM NEW ABILITIES, LIKE JUMPING AND FIRING A LASER GUN. HE ALSO HAS TO EVADE CAPTURE BY SECURITY PERSONNEL AND OTHER ROBOTS.
ONCE HE HAS ESCAPED FROM THE LAB, HE HAS TO SURVIVE ON THE OUTSIDE BY EVADING WILD ANIMALS AND HIS HUMAN AND ROBOT PURSUERS.

THE GAME COMBINES ACTION AND ADVENTURE ELEMENTS. IN THE LAB, YOU CAN SEARCH FOR AND PICK UP ITEMS AND USE THEM TO FIND YOUR WAY TO THE EXIT. ONCE OUTSIDE, YOU HAVE TO JUMP AND SHOOT TO SURVIVE.</desc>

TAKE ONE OF THE "FLEET BOATS" AND GO ON EXTENDED PATROLS OF UP TO 2 MONTHS FROM HAWAII, AUSTRALIA, OR NEW ZEALAND.

CONTEND WITH FACTORS LIKE DUD TORPEDOES, MAXIMUM DEPTH, AND MORE. 

YOU CAN CHOOSE AMONG PRACTICE RUN AGAINST SOME OLD HULKS, RECREATE HISTORICAL CONVOY ATTACKS, GO ON A SINGLE PATROL, OR GO ON YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN, WHICH LETS YOU GO MULTIPLE PATROLS UNTIL YOU DIE, GET PROMOTED, OR SURVIVE THE WAR.

PLAYER 1 WOULD PLAY AS A HELICOPTER, BUT IF A SECOND PLAYER JOINED THE GAME, THEY WOULD PLAY AS A JEEP. BOTH PLAYERS WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THEMSELVES. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF KILLS, A "GOOSE" HELICOPTER WOULD FORM ON THE SCREEN. IF THE PLAYERS MANAGED TO DESTROY IT THEY WOULD GET A WEAPONS POWERUP. THIS WOULD GO ON THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME (A "GOOSE" COULD APPEAR EVEN DURING THE END OF LEVEL BADDIE!).</desc>

	<desc>SOCCER PINBALL IS A PINBALL GAME WITH EIGHT ROUND SPLIT ACROSS THREE TABLES. ON THE SOCCER-THEMED LEVELS, A 'GOAL' IS GUARDED BY 'DEFENDERS' WHO MUST BE REMOVED BY HITTING THEM. SCORE THREE GOALS TO REACH THE NEXT LEVEL - INITIALLY YOU WILL FACE ANOTHER SOCCER-BASED TABLE WITH MORE DEFENDERS. OTHER FOOTBALL-THEMED ELEMENTS INCLUDE 'THROW-IN' POSITIONS FROM THE SIDE AND POP-UP PLAYERS TO TOGGLE FOR POINTS. 

ON THE AMIGA VERSION, THE LATER TABLES HAVE A CASINO AND GAMBLING AS A THEME. GAMEPLAY IS FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME - HIT THE CORRECT TARGETS IN SEQUENCE TO ADVANCE, WITH OTHER TARGETS ADDING TO YOUR SCORE.</desc>

THE JOURNEY IS LARGELY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, ALTHOUGH DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS THROUGH GAPS AND UPWARD MOVEMENTS ON ROTATING PLATFORMS ARE ALSO FREQUENT. SOME DROPS CAN BE FATAL, BUT MOSTLY THOSE WHICH HAVE A PLATFORM IN CLOSE REACH, SO THESE ARE AVOIDABLE AND NOT PURELY RANDOM. THERE ARE MANY MAGIC TELEPORTS EN ROUTE, AND THE HIGH TREES NARROW THE JOURNEY. EXTRA LIVES (VIA COLLECTING 8 CRYSTALS) AND IMPROVED WEAPONRY ARE ON OFFER THROUGHOUT YOUR QUEST.</desc>

LIFEFORMS. UNTIL NOW, THE CHIEF DANGERS HAD BEEN 
THOSE POSED BY THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE. UNTIL NOW, THE ALIENS HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT THEM.

ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE GALAXY, OTHER CREATURES THAT ROAM THE STARS DISCOVER HUMANS AND SPACESHIPS TO BE EXCELLENT SOURCES OF FOOD AND OTHER RESOURCES. PREPARED AT THE WORST FOR CLASHES WITH RIVAL EXPLORATION TEAMS, THE HUMAN CREWS CAN DO LITTLE TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES AS WAVE UPON WAVE OF NIGHTMARE
CREATURES DESCEND UPON THEIR SHIPS AND BASES.

IN RESPONSE TO THEIR DISTRESS CALLS, THE FEDERATION HAS ASSEMBLED A SERIES OF RESCUE TEAMS, LEAD BY THEIR BEST MILITARY SHARPSHOOTERS, TO DEAL WITH THE ALIEN MENACE. AS THE LEADER OF ONE OF THESE TEAMS, YOU MUST GUN DOWN THE INTRUDERS AND PICK UP THE HUMAN SURVIVORS. BRAVE THE MAZE OF DARK CORRIDORS THAT MAY LEAD TO A DEADLY SHOOTOUT BETWEEN YOU AND LEGIONS OF MONSTERS. PICK UP SURVIVORS AND EXTRA AMMO ON THE WAY.</desc>

SIMPLY REACHING THE BALL USUALLY INVOLVES MODIFYING THE LEVEL LAYOUT USING THESE BRICKS. THERE ARE ENEMIES MOVING ON FIXED PATHS WHICH MUST BE AVOIDED, AND BONUS ITEMS TO COLLECT. ALSO WATCH FOR BONUSES SUCH AS INVINCIBILITY, GRAVITY-ALTERATION AND TELEPORTING. YOU TAKE TIME TO ROTATE, SO THE CONTROLS AREN'T TRULY IMMEDIATE. THE BALL TAKES 20 SECONDS TO START MOVING, SO USE THIS TIME TO PLAN AHEAD.</desc>

	<desc>THIS FLIGHT SIMULATION SETS YOU AS A YOUNG SPITFIRE PILOT IN 1940, WHEN WORLD WAR 2 IS HOTTING UP IN THE SKIES OVER THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND. THE PROGRAM IS VIEWED FROM WITHIN THE COCKPIT, WITH THE INSTRUMENT PANEL VIEWED BY PRESSING SPACE. THE PILOT WILL HAVE TO CO-ORDINATE LANDING GEAR, BRAKES AND RUDDERING, AND USE A MAP TO NAVIGATE AND FIND TARGETS. LOOPS, ROLLS AND SPLIT-S MOVES ARE ALL INCORPORATED IN THE SIMULATION LOGIC.

THE GAME CAN GENERATE RANDOM COMBAT SITUATIONS - FOR EXAMPLE, 6 ENEMIES 10 MILES AWAY, 1500 FEET INTO THE AIR. ONCE YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED A STRONG FLIGHT RECORD YOU CAN TAKE ON THE MISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE PRACTICE MODES FOR BOTH FLYING AND COMBAT.</desc>

THE BASIC PREMISE INVOLVES BEING PRESENTED WITH 1 OF 10 PICTURES (REPRESENTING FAMOUS FIGURES SUCH AS RONALD REAGAN, MAGGIE THATCHER, LADY DIANA AND EVEN SIR CLIVE SINCLAIR), WITH THE COMPLETE PICTURE PRESENTED AT THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN. YOU MUST MOVE YOUR CURSOR ONTO THE, PICK UP A PIECE, AND PLACE IT ONTO THE MAIN PLAYING AREA, ENSURING THAT YOU CAN MOVE THE OTHERS INTO PLACE. UNLIKE WITH THE PLASTIC VERSIONS THERE ARE 16 PIECES TO FIT INTO 20 SPACES, ALLOWING MORE LEEWAY IN TERMS OF CONTINUAL SLIDING. THE COMPLICATIONS IN THIS VERSION INCLUDE GAPS IN THE PLAYING AREA WHICH SWALLOW PIECES AND RETURN THEM TO THE BANK, A TIME LIMIT, BOMBS WHICH HAVE TO BE MOVED OFF THE SCREEN TO AVOID LOSING A LIFE, AND BONUS OBJECTS TO BE MOVED IN SPECIFIC WAYS FOR BONUS POINTS.</desc>

YOUR CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH MACHINE GUNS TO HELP YOU GET PAST THE NUMEROUS ENEMIES OUT ON THE ROAD (BE CAREFUL NOT TO SHOOT ANY CIVILIANS, THOUGH!) OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL COME ACROSS A WEAPONS VAN, AND IF YOU DRIVE INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN YOUR CAR BECOMES EQUIPPED WITH A SECOND WEAPON (SUCH AS SMOKE SCREEN, OIL SLICK, OR MISSILES.) AT SEVERAL POINTS THE ROAD SPLITS AND YOU CAN ENTER A BOATHOUSE WHICH TRANSFORMS YOUR CAR INTO A BOAT TEMPORARILY. IF YOU DRIVE FAR ENOUGH THE SEASONS CHANGE AS WELL (WATCH OUT FOR ICY CONDITIONS DURING WINTER!) THE ENEMY CARS WILL DO ANYTHING TO STOP YOU, INCLUDING RUNNING YOU OFF THE ROAD, FIRING GUNS FROM THE BACK OF A LIMMO, OR DROPPING BOMBS FROM A HELICOPTER.</desc>

THE ALLIANCE AND HIERARCHY EACH POSSESS DIFFERENT TYPES OF WARSHIPS. EACH VESSEL HAS ITS OWN MANEUVERING AND FIRING CHARACTERISTICS, PLUS A UNIQUE SPECIAL POWER THAT YOU CAN EMPLOY WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE.

THE GAME HAS TWO MODULES: THE MELEE, IN WHICH YOU CAN SIMPLY BLAST THE COMPUTER OR ANOTHER PLAYER TO SMITHEREENS USING ONE OF 16 DIFFERENT SHIPS, IN EITHER HIERARCHY OR ALLIANCE FLEETS; OR, SHOULD YOU WISH FOR A MORE CHALLENGING GAME, LETS YOU PLAY ONE OF 9 PRESET SCENARIOS.</desc>

	<desc>THE PLANET NOVENIA HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY THE EGRONS, WHO SNUCK IN BY DISGUISING THEIR CRAFT AS THE PROTECTED STARGLIDER SPECIES, WHICH NOVENIA'S AUTOMATED DEFENSES WERE PROGRAMMED NOT TO SHOOT. 

YOUR TASK IS TO FIGHT THEM OFF USING ONLY AN OBSOLETE AIRBORNE GROUND ATTACK VEHICLE. THIS WAS DESIGNED AS THE ULTIMATE COMBAT MACHINE, WITH SOPHISTICATED HARDWARE UP TO DRAZIW YARG'S HIGH STANDARDS. IT HAS A FULLY-RECHARGEABLE SHIELD, PLASMA DRIVE UNIT, AN INBUILT SCANNER AND 10,000-SECTOR MAP, A TOP SPEED OF 2550 URADS AND TWO HOMING MISSILES.

THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM WITHIN AGAV'S COCKPIT, WITH CONTROL OVER SPEED, WEAPON TARGETING AND FIRING. THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTROL OPTIONS TO DECIDE EXACTLY HOW THE CRAFT WORKS, WITH FIXED OR FLOATING SIGHTING, AND THE OPTION OF AUTOMATIC CENTERING, ALLOWING YOU TO BALANCE THE GAME BETWEEN EASY SIGHTING AND ADVANCED SHOOTING RANGES.

REPAIR DEPOTS MUST BE VISITED FREQUENTLY, AS THEY CAN REFILL THE WEAPON BAYS AS WELL AS REPAIRING THE SHIP. CRUCIALLY, THE EGRON STARGLIDERS NEED 3 MISSILES TO SHOOT DOWN, SO AT LEAST 1 VISIT TO A DEPOT IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS JOB, AT WHICH POINT YOU MOVE UP TO THE NEXT, HARDER, LEVEL.</desc>

TO DO THIS HE MUST BLOW BUBBLES TO CATCH THE GRUBS THAT THEY FEED ON AND GUIDE THEM THROUGH THE LEVEL BY BLOWING ON THEM OR NUDGING THEM PAST ANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY TO THE NEST WHERE T'YUNGUNZ LIVE.  TO COMPLETE A LEVEL, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF T'YUNGUNZ ARE FULLY FED SO THEY GO TO SLEEP.  IF THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH FOOD THEN EVENTUALLY THEY DIE.

THE LEVELS ARE FULL OF CONTRAPTIONS SUCH AS BELLOWS, AND OBSTACLES SUCH AS SPIKES AND FIRE THAT WILL BURST THE BUBBLES.  SOME OF THESE CAN BE ACTIVATED OR DEACTIVATED USING VARIOUS SWITCHES.

USUALLY STEG NAVIGATES EACH LEVEL BY WALKING ON THE FLOOR, AND ALSO HE CAN CLIMB UP THE WALLS AND EVEN WALK ON THE CEILING.  THERE ARE ALSO DEVICES HE CAN CONTRUCT OUT OF THE PARTS FROM THE ACME BIONIC BITZ CATALOGUE, SUCH AS THE ROCKET PACK, AND BIONIC LEGS, WHICH ALLOW DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING AROUND EACH LEVEL.</desc>

	<desc>MIKE LAMB RECREATED THE BASIC RULES OF THE POPULAR ENGLISH GAME OF SNOOKER IN THIS SIMULATION, WHICH CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR TWO PLAYERS, BUT HAS NO COMPUTER OPPONENT AS SUCH, UNLIKE THE LATER 16-BIT REMAKE.

INSTEAD, YOU ARE SCORED BASED NOT ONLY ON HOW MANY POINTS YOU SCORE LEGITIMATELY, BUT ALSO ON HOW MANY POINTS YOU CONCEDE THROUGH FOUL SHOTS, AND HOW MANY SHOTS YOU TAKE IN TOTAL. YOU ALWAYS TAKE THE NEXT SHOT, EVEN IF YOU'VE MISSED OR FOULED, SO IN A ONE PLAYER GAME THE BREAK-BUILDING STRATEGIES CAN BE SLIGHTLY MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN IN A REAL MATCH, AS THERE'S NO RISK OF LEAVING AN OPPONENT A CHANCE

AS IN THE REAL GAME YOU START OFF BY TRYING TO POT A RED (THERE ARE 10 OR THE REAL 15, DEPENDING ON WHICH MODE YOU CHOOSE), AND IF SUCCESSFUL CHOOSING ONE OF THE 6 COLOURS (BY PRESSING THE NUMBER CORRESPONDING TO ITS POINTS VALUE). ONCE YOU'VE LINED UP THE DIRECTION OF THE SHOT, YOU WILL HAVE TO SET THE SPEED, AND THEN THE SPIN.</desc>

THE ACTION-CENTERED NATURE OF THE TITLE MEANS THAT IT CAN BE SEEN AS AN ADVANCED SHOOT 'EM UP RATHER THAN A PUKKA FLIGHT SIMULATOR.

ACQUIRING A LOCK ON ENEMY PLANES AND TANKS IS MADE EASIER BY THE ADVANCED TARGETING TECHNOLOGY OF THE PLANES, AND ESCAPING ENEMY FIRE IS AIDED BY THE VECTORED THRUST SYSTEM. SHOOTING OUT THE TANKS CLEARS GROUND SPACE TO SET UP YOUR OWN BASES, WHICH MUST THEN BE DEFENDED. VTOL (VERTICAL TAKE-OFF AND LANDING) IS CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, ALTHOUGH MORE TRADITIONAL HORIZONTAL TAKE-OFFS SHOULD BE USED WHEN SPACE PERMITS. THE FULL RANGE OF WEAPONS ARE PROVIDED; EXPERIENCE WILL TELL YOU WHICH TO USE IN WHICH SITUATIONS, BASED ON ENEMY VOLUME AND RANGE.</desc>

	<desc>SUBBUTEO RECREATES THE FAMOUS TABLE FOOTBALL GAME, WHICH MAKES FOR SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM SENSIBLE/KICK OFF/FIFA STYLE GAMES. IT'S EFFECTIVELY A TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAME OF SORTS, AS EACH PLAYER HAS 30 SECONDS TO MAKE THEIR MOVE (WITHIN A 30 MINUTE MATCH LENGTH), WHICH INVOLVES FIRST SELECTING A PLAYER, THEN AIMING THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE WILL BE FLICKED, THEN THE POWER AND SWERVE OF THE FLICK ARE DETERMINED BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THE BUTTON IS HELD DOWN FOR. 

WITH ANY LUCK, YOUR PLAYER WILL HIT THE BALL, AND HIT IT SUCH THAT IT DOESN'T LEAVE THE PLAYING AREA, AND DOESN'T HIT AN OPPONENT. IF ANY OF THOSE RULES ARE VIOLATED, POSSESSION PASSES TO THE OPPOSITION. BEFORE EACH FLICK, THE TEAM NOT IN POSSESSION CAN MAKE A 'DEFENSIVE FLICK' INVOLVING MOVING ONE OF THEIR PLAYERS INTO A POTENTIAL BLOCKING POSITION (WITHOUT HITTING THE BALL OR AN OPPONENT, AS THIS IS A FOUL).</desc>

	<desc>EIGHT OLYMPIC EVENTS FEATURE IN THIS GAME, AND ANY SELECTION OF THESE CAN BE PLAYED AT A TIME. THERE IS NO PURE SPRINTING, AND ONLY THE ROWING AND CYCLING CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS PURE JOYSTICK-WAGGLING. THE TRIPLE JUMP INVOLVES PRESSING RIGHT TO START THE HOP (BEFORE REACHING THE WHITE LINE), RIGHT AGAIN FOR THE STEP AS YOU LAND, LEFT AS YOU LAND FOR THE JUMP, AND THEN UP TO PROPEL YOU THROUGH THE SAND.  I HIGH JUMP, AFTER SELECTING A HEIGHT YOU FEEL YOU CAN CLEAR, YOU USE UP AND DOWN TO CONTROL THE SPEED, FIRE TO JUMP, AND THEN FORWARD TO PROPEL YOU OVER THE BAR.

FOR THE JAVELIN EVEN YOU HOLD DOWN FIRE TO BUILD UP SPEED, AND PUSH LEFT TO THROW THE JAVELIN, HOLDING IT LEFT BEFORE RELEASING TO CHANGE THE ANGLE. IN THE EQUESTRIAN EVENT, YOU MUST USE UP TO INCREASE SPEED, AND FIRE OR RIGHT TO JUMP WHEN APPROPRIATE TO CLEAR THE HAZARDS - TOO MANY FAULTS WILL SEE YOU DISQUALIFIED.

FENCING INVOLVES MOVING YOUR FOIL USING THE JOYSTICK, ALWAYS STAYING ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOUR OPPONENT, RETREATING WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE KAYAKING EVENT INVOLVES NAVIGATING A RIVER BY CONTROLLING THE DIRECTION, ENSURING THAT ALL THE GATES ARE PAST CORRECTLY EVEN WHEN THIS REQUIRES SOME PRECISE LINING UP. YOU CAN ALSO LOAD THE EVENTS FROM SUMMER GAMES 1 IN, TO PLAY ALL 16 EVENTS IN A MARATHON SESSION.</desc>

THE GAME USES A SPLIT-SCREEN DISPLAY, WITH A BIG WINDOW VIEWED FROM THE SIDE AS WELL AS A LONGER-RANGE AERIAL VIEW - THE LATTER IS USEFUL FOR DODGING HAZARDS TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, AS THE SIDE-VIEW DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE THESE ACCURATELY. THE BIKE HAS 3 GEARS, AND YOU MUST USE A LOW GEAR TO GO UPHILL. YOU WILL NEED TO DO WHEELIES TO ENSURE GOOD LANDINGS FROM THE BIG JUMPS, AND TO CLEAR DIVOTS IN THE GROUND.</desc>

	<desc>8 CHALLENGING ZONES OF BATTLE AWAIT YOU IN YOUR ROLE AS A TANK DRIVER. THE GAME IS VIEWED FROM ABOVE, WITH ROTATIONAL CONTROL AND FORWARD/REVERSE POWER FOR THE TANK. THE ROUTES TO TRAVEL ALONG ARE NARROW AND VARIED, SO SOME EXPLORATION IS REQUIRED  SOME PATHS ARE INEVITABLY SAFER AND FASTER THAN OTHERS. THE WALLS ARE PARTICULARLY USEFUL AS THEY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFLECT SHOTS, SO YOU CAN OFTEN ATTACK FROM SAFE POSITIONS ROUND A CORNER.

OPPOSITION INCLUDES GUN TURRETS FIRING AT YOU, ENEMY TANKS AND LANDMINES. YOU START WITH A STANDARD GUN, WHICH MUST BE HELD DOWN LONGER TO TAKE OUT TOUGHER FOES, BUT CAN COLLECT SMART BOMBS AND SHIELDS. A FIRST-PERSON VIEWPOINT SECTION FOLLOWS EACH OF THESE SECTIONS, WITH THE SIGHTING UNDER YOUR CONTROL, AND MORE HELICOPTERS AND JEEPS TO TAKE ON.</desc>

	<desc>IN THIS PUZZLE BOARD GAME YOU SHOULD SWAP THE TILES TO MAKE THE SEQUENCE OF TILES OF THE SAME COLOR TO ELIMINATE THEM.
SHAPE OF TILES VARIES FROM BIG AND SMALL SQUARES TO TRIANGLES OR HEXAGONS. IF TILES HAVE NO NEIGHBOR TILES YOU MAY TAKE APPROPRIATE TILES FROM THE POCKET OF THE LIMITED SIZE TO ELIMINATE THE REST OF THE TILES. FINISHING THE LEVEL, PLAYER WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE HIGHER LEVEL IF THE RESULTS OF THE CURRENT LEVEL WERE HIGH ENOUGH FOR SUCH LEVEL. BUT TO FINISH LEVEL SUCCESSFULLY, PLAYER SHOULD ACQUIRE THE CERTAIN NUMBER OF POINTS AND TO BE QUALIFIED FOR THE NEXT LEVEL. THE DIFFICULTY ALSO RAISES AND DEPENDS ON QUANTITY OF COLOURS, THE SHAPE OF THE TILES, AND TIME LIMIT PRESENCE. UNDO MOVES ARE ALSO PRESENT, BUT SUCH MOVES DECREASE YOUR FINAL RESULTS. GAME MAY BE SAVED IN PROGRESS AND LOADED LATER. 

BEST SCORES AND LEVELS WILL BE WRITTEN IN HIGH SCORE TABLE.</desc>

	<desc>WITH APRIL O'NEIL HELD HOSTAGE BY THE SHREDDER'S THUGS, BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY, ONCE AGAIN, IT'S UP TO THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES TO COME TO HER RESCUE!  PLAY AS ALL FOUR OF THE TURTLE HEROES, RESCUE APRIL, AND THEN RESCUE YOUR SENSEI SPLINTER FROM MECHA-TURTLES CLUTCHES THAN GO AFTER THE SHREDDER DEEP IN THE BOWELS OF THE TECHNODROME ITSELF.

TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES IS AN ACTION GAME BASED ON THE LATE EIGHTIES/EARLY NINETIES CARTOON SERIES OF THE SAME NAME. PLAY AS LEONARDO, MICHAELANGELO, DONATELLO AND RAPHAEL (ONE TURTLE ONLY, BUT THE ABILITY TO SWAP BETWEEN TURTLES AT ANY TIME) AS YOU SAVE YOUR FRIENDS AND BATTLE THE SHREDDER AND HIS CRONIES. THERE ARE NO 'LIVES', AS SUCH - WHEN YOU LOSE A TURTLE, HE BECOMES 'CAPTURED', AND YOU CANNOT USE HIM AGAIN UNTIL YOU RESCUE HIM FROM A PLACE HIDDEN IN THE OVERWORLD.

GAMEPLAY TAKES PLACE IN TWO PERSPECTIVES: A TOP-DOWN VIEW, WHICH LETS YOU RUN AROUND AND EXPLORE BUILDINGS, SEWERS AND OTHER PLACES. WHEN ENTERING PLACES FROM THE TOP-DOWN VIEW, THE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS TO A SIDE-SCROLLING VIEW, WHERE MOST OF THE BATTLING TAKES PLACE. IN ADDITION TO EACH TURTLE'S MAIN WEAPON, SUB-WEAPONS (SUCH AS SHURIKEN) CAN BE ACQUIRED, TO USE AT FOES - THESE HAVE A LIMITED USE.</desc>

NOW ONE DAY, BERK, ALONG WITH HIS FRIEND DRUTT, DECIDED TO EXPLORE HIS DOMAIN BY GOING THROUGH THE TRAP DOOR.

YOU TAKE CONTROL OF BOTH DRUTT AND BERK, SWAPPING BETWEEN THEM WITH THE FIRE BUTTON. THEY NEED TO SOLVE A SERIES OF PUZZLES AND DEAL WITH NEW CREATURES ALONG THE WAY. THERE ARE FOUR REGIONS TO EXPLORE, AND OPENING LOCKED DOORS GIVE ACCESS TO LATER REGIONS. SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS ARE SWEETS AND TOADSTOOLS WHICH, WHEN CONSUMED, WILL PROVIDE BERK WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS. PROGRESS IS MADE BY USING THE TWO CHARACTERS TOGETHER, AS DRUTT CAN REACH PLACES THAT BERK CANNOT.</desc>

	<name>TITAN</name>
	<desc>TITAN IS A 2D ARCADE GAME / PUZZLE GAME HYBRID.

FOR SOME REASON, MAD PROFESSORS OF THE FUTURE TEND TO INVENT STRANGE ENTERTAINMENT GAMES IN WHICH EVERY PARTICIPANT DIES. PROFESSOR HYBRYS VARIANT IS CALLED TITAN AND INVOLVES A BALL, A CONTROL UNIT AND 80 LABYRINTHS. YOUR OBJECTIVE IS EITHER TO DESTROY ALL DESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS IN EACH LEVEL BY HITTING THEM WITH THE SPHERE, OR TO PILOT IT TO THE EXIT. THE BLACK BALL IS BEYOND YOUR CONTROL; IT WILL BOUNCE STRAIGHT OR DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE LABYRINTH WITH CONSTANT SPEED. YOU MOVE THE CONTROL UNIT, A SMALL BOX, WITH YOU ARE TO POSITION IN A WAY THAT THE BALL BOUNCES OFF IT IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION. YOU CAN ALSO CATCH THE SPHERE BY QUICKLY MOVING OVER IT, AND THEN RELEASE IT IN A DIRECTION OF YOUR CHOICE.

THE LABYRINTHS NOT ONLY CONTAIN HARMLESS, DESTRUCTIBLE BLOCKS, BUT ALSO INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT HAZARDS. IF THE SPHERE OR YOUR CONTROL UNIT HIT A SKULL SYMBOL, ONE OF YOUR NINE LIVES IS LOST. TELEPORTERS EXCHANGE THE POSITION OF YOU AND THE BALL, WALL PIECES CAN BE PUSHED AROUND OR DESTROYED BY YOUR UNIT, FLOOR TILES WILL GROW INTO WALLS WHEN YOU PASS OVER THEM TOO OFTEN. THE HIGH GAME SPEED CAN BE SLOWED DOWN BY HOLDING THE SPACE KEY  A VERY USEFUL OPTION IN TRICKY SITUATIONS.

TITAN MIXES AN ARCADE GAME FOUNDATION (REQUIRING QUICK REFLEXES AND GOOD NERVES) WITH PUZZLE GAME ELEMENTS (REQUIRING LOGICAL THINKING TO BEAT THE COMPLEX LEVELS). THE CHALLENGE IS TO CONTROL THE SPHERE ACCURATELY, YET INDIRECTLY.</desc>

AS A DEMONSTRATION OF ITS POWERS, ARTHUR TRANSFORMS THE ISLE OF WHITE INTO A GIANT CUSTARD SLICE, NEW YORK INTO A BATH SPONGE AND THE EIFFEL TOWER INTO A TOAST RACK. THE GHOST BLINKY, SECRET AGENT FOR S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF ECTOPLASMIC CRIME, TELEKINETIC MISUSE AND REALITY ENDANGERMENT), INFILTRATES THE MADMAN'S SEA SHIP (THE NEWLY RAISED SS TITANIC) ARMED WITH AN ECTOPLASMIC GUN AND A CASE FULL OF DISGUISES.

TITANIC BLINKY IS A PLATFORM ADVENTURE AND A CLONE OF DIZZY, REPLACING THE EGG PROTAGONIST WITH A SLIGHTLY EFFEMINATE GHOST. AS IN THAT GAME, THE AIM IS TO COLLECT OBJECTS (BY PULLING DOWN ON THE MOVEMENT CONTROLS) TO SOLVE PUZZLES. ONE MAIN DIFFERENCE FROM DIZZY IS THE FACT THAT BLINKY CARRIES A GUN WITH INFINITE AMMUNITION. THERE'S AN ENERGY BAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THAT GETS DEPLETED EVERY TIME BLINKY TOUCHES AN ENEMY. WHEN IT'S EMPTY, BLINKY LITERALLY FLIPS OVER AND THE PLAYER LOSES ONE LIFE. THE GAME STARTS WITH THREE LIVES, AND THERE'S NO FORM OF SAVING PROGRESS.</desc>

	<desc>FLIGHT SIMULATION SPECIALISTS DIGITAL INTEGRATION TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO HELICOPTER FLIGHT IN THIS RECREATION OF THE AH-64 APACHE. ALL THE CONTROLS ARE REALISTICALLY SIMULATED, SO THE AIRSPEED IS DEPENDENT ON THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE, AND YOU CAN MOVE HORIZONTALLY USING THE RUDDER OPTION AS WELL AS ROLLING LEFT AND RIGHT. IF USING A SINCLAIR JOYSTICK INTERFACE YOU CAN USE BOTH PORTS TO HAVE ALL THESE CONTROLS ACCESSIBLE ON DUAL JOYSTICKS, JUST LIKE THE REAL THING. EITHER WAY, A FULL INSTRUMENT PANEL ALLOWS MONITORING OF THESE.

YOU ARE ARMED WITH CANNONS, ROCKETS AND ANTI-TANK MISSILES, EACH OF WHICH HAS ITS TARGET SET UP INDEPENDENTLY, BUT ONLY ONE CAN BE LOADED AT ONCE. FLIGHT OPTIONS INCLUDE DAY/NIGHT, CLEAR/CLOUDY AND AIR TURBULENCE ON/OFF, ALLOWING BEGINNERS AND EXPERTS TO FIND A SUITABLE SETTING. SCENERY INCLUDES TREES, MOUNTAINS AND PYLONS, WHILE ENEMY TARGETS INCLUDE HELICOPTERS, TURRETS AND TANKS.</desc>

IN ORDER TO DO THIS, QUAID MUST GO THROUGH LEVEL AFTER LEVEL OF BEATING UP BAD GUYS THAT GET IN HIS WAY.

SOME OF THE LEVELS DIFFER IN GAMEPLAY, AND RANGE BETWEEN ACTION AND DRIVING SCENES. THE ACTION SCENES MAINLY REQUIRE YOU TO COLLECT SOME ITEMS BEFORE LEAVING THE LEVEL. YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHANCE TO COMPLETE THE CURRENT LEVEL, WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOUR ENERGY IS LOST, THE GAME ENDS. ENERGY IS LOST IF YOU ARE ATTACKED BY AN OBSTACLE, OR IF YOU ARE SHOT AT BY AN ENEMY. YOU CAN GAIN MORE ENERGY BY EITHER COLLECTING SOME PILLS OR A HEART, DEPENDING ON THE PLATFORM.</desc>

A WIDE RANGE OF TACTICAL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO DICTATE THE TEAM'S PASSING STYLE, DEFENSIVE APPROACH AND SO ON, AND IN ANOTHER FIRST YOU CAN GIVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS (MAYBE TELLING A PARTICULARLY PACY DEFENDER TO MAN-MARK A DANGEROUS OPPOSITION WINGER INSTEAD OF STAYING IN A SET POSITION).</desc>

A MAP IS BUILT INTO THE CAR, WHICH CAN INSTANTLY SHOW THE POSITIONS OF THE BARON'S CARS - THIS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T INTERRUPT THEM BEFORE THE INITIAL DEAL IS DONE, AS THIS WILL SIMPLY MAKE THEM LEAVE AND TRY AGAIN ANOTHER TIME.

THE GAME'S ENVIRONMENT IS LARGE AND VARIED, WITH TRAFFIC LIGHTS, JUNCTIONS AND ZEBRA CROSSINGS ACCURATELY IMPLEMENTED, AND PEDESTRIANS TO AVOID. THE ROADS ARE MULTI-LANED, AND AT THE END OF EACH ROAD YOU CAN TURN ACROSS, WHICH MAKES THE GAME'S PERSPECTIVE SHIFT IN A FLICK-SCREEN MANNER. ONE UNUSUAL FEATURE FOR THE TIME IS A SAVEABLE HIGH-SCORE TABLE.</desc>

TAKING THE ROLE OF TURBO THE TORTOISE, THE PLAYER MUST TRAVEL THROUGH SIX SIDE-SCROLLING PLATFORM LEVELS, EACH OF THEM WELL-GUARDED BY ENEMIES. LIMITED WEAPONRY CAN BE COLLECTED, ALTHOUGH JUMPING ON THE HEADS OF THESE FOES WILL ALSO KILL THEM. TURBO MUST ALLOW FOR MOVING PLATFORMS, SWITCHES, FRAGILE PLATFORMS AND WATER HAZARDS. ENHANCEMENTS AND EXTRA LIVES ARE IN HARD-TO-REACH PLACES, OFTEN ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY USING ENEMY HEADS AS LAUNCH PADS.</desc>

THIS SIDE SCROLLING ARCADE ADVENTURE IS SPLIT INTO THREE STAGES, TAKING IN THE HARSH AND BARREN DESERT, AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK OF CAVES, AND A TOUGH TRIBAL JUNGLE. THE NATIVES ARE HOSTILE TO YOUR PRESENCE, AND WEAPONRY MUST BE FOUND TO FEND THEM OFF, ALTHOUGH ITS USE DOES LITTLE TO PUT THE NATIVES AT EASE INITIALLY. THE MACHETE TO CUT THROUGH THE JUNGLE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AT MANY OTHER POINTS YOU WILL NEED TO USE OBJECTS YOU HAVE FOUND ALONG THE WAY. THE BACKGROUNDS ARE IN FULL 3D AND CAN SERVE TO OBSCURE THE CHARACTER WHEN HE IS BEHIND TREES OR ROCKS.</desc>

	<desc>SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOT-EM-UP, IN A SIMILAR STYLE TO SUCH GAMES AS GRADIUS, R-TYPE AND SCRAMBLE. THE AIM IS TO WIPE OUT THE ENEMY, WHICH HAS GATHERED AROUND THE ALLIED AIRSPACE OF 'AREA 88', IN A SERIES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT-BASED SCENARIOS.
 YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THREE UNIQUE PILOTS; SHIN KAZAMA, MICKY SCHYMON OR GREG GATES, EACH WITH VARYING ABILITIES AT DAMAGE REPAIR, WEAPON HANDLING AND FLYING SKILL, AND ENGAGE THE ENEMY OVER A SERIES OF CHALLENGING MISSIONS. THE PLAYER STARTS OUT WITH THE WEAKEST PLANE, THE F8E CRUSADER, WHICH CAN ONLY BE ARMED WITH A VERY BASIC RANGE WEAPONS. BUT, THROUGH COMPLETING VARIOUS MISSIONS, ENOUGH CASH CAN BE RAISED TO PURCHASE HIGHER-QUALITY AIRCRAFT. THESE SUPERIOR PLANES ARE MORE AGILE, HAVE IMPROVED RESILIENCE TO DAMAGE AND HAVE A GREATER RANGE OF FIRE. FURTHERMORE, THE MORE ADVANCED FIGHTERS CAN BE ARMED WITH SUPERIOR SPECIAL WEAPONS, SUCH AS NAPALM.
 THE MISSIONS INCLUDE ATTACKS ON SAND BASES, THE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE 'SEAVET' AND ENEMY SUPPLY CAMPS, AS WELL AS SEEING OFF GROUPS OF AIRBORNE 'BANDITS' WHO SWARM-IN ON AREA 88.
 THE ENEMY IS PLENTIFUL, AND THE PACE IS FRANTIC. SHOOT AT EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN THAT MOVES, AND THE ALLIED FORCES MIGHT JUST COME OUT ON TOP......</desc>

THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO ESCAPE, EACH PROTECTED BY A GUARDIAN WHO CAN BE KILLED USING ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR WEAPONS YOU CAN LOCATE  A DAGGER, A TORCH AND A KNIFE.

AS YOU EXPLORE THE LEVELS, YOU WILL ENCOUNTER RANDOMLY-MOVING NASTIES, WHO CANT KILL YOU BUT CAN KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR PATH AND CAUSE YOU TO FALL. EAGLES CAN GRAB AND DROP YOU IN MID-AIR. FALLS OF MUCH MORE THAN A SCREENS HEIGHT COST YOU A LIFE, ALTHOUGH EXTRA ONES ARE AVAILABLE. JEWELS CAN BE COLLECTED FOR TEMPORARY INVINCIBILITY.

THE GAMES SCREENS ARE FUNCTIONALLY SPLIT INTO CASTLE AND CAVERNS, WITH THE CASTLE SCREENS HIGHER UP. MOVING ACROSS THE CASTLES INVOLVES A LOT OF BLIND JUMPS, OFTEN DELIBERATELY BOUNCING OFF FORTUITOUSLY-PLACED OBJECTS SUCH AS FLOWER POTS. IN THE CAVERNS, USE A ROPE TO HOOK ONTO THE CEILINGS AND MOVE UP AND DOWN  IF YOU HAVE FOUND IT. HOW MANY SCREENS DEEP YOU ARE IS NOTED ON SCREEN AT ALL TIMES.</desc>

	<desc>NEW-YORK, YEAR 1998. THE ONCE MOST PRESTIGIOUS CITY IN THE WORLD, HAS NOW BECOME A FIGHTING ZONE.
HALF OF THE CITY IS LEFT IN RUINS, AND IT IS IN THAT PART OF TOWN THAT THE MARGINALS AND GANGS ARE LIVING, HUNTED BY EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE OTHER HALF OF THE CITY CONSISTS OF FANCY MANSIONS, IN SOME OF WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT DRUG BARONS RESIDE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO RUN THE CITY USING THE ENORMOUS PROFITS THEY MAKE FROM DEALING DRUGS AND WEAPONS.
THEY NOW HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ENDANGERING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WANTING TO AVOID A TERRIBLE CRISIS, CALLED THE CIA TO RUN SEVERAL TYPES OF OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THIS BAD SUBSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENT.
THE C.I.A., HEADED UP BY "THE BOSS", HAS TO CLEAN UP THE CITY OF ITS CROOKS.
ONE PLAN IS TO REORGANIZE THE CITY BY PLACING SECURITY CHECK-POINTS AT STRATEGIC POSITIONS.
THE OPERATION WAS SET UP FOR APRIL 4, AND QUICKLY PROVED TO BE AN UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS.
THE BADLY ORGANIZED, SMALLER STREET GANGS, WERE GREATLY OUTNUMBERED AND COULDN'T MATCH THE EXTREMELY WELL ARMED LAW ENFORCEMENT TROOPS.

ON MAY 7, DURING A SUCCESSFUL RAID, THE STATE POLICE SPECIAL BRANCH, TOOK POSSESSION OF A HUGE ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION, WORTH MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS.
THIS RAID WAS AN IMPORTANT STAGE IN THE WHOLE OPERATION.
REALIZING THE STICKY SITUATION THEY WERE IN, THE HEADS OF THE CRIME ORGANIZATIONS NOW STARTED MAKING PLANS FOR THEMSELVES: THEY NEEDED TO REGAIN THEIR CONTROL OVER THE CITY AND ABOVE ALL, SECURE THEIR TERRITORIES.
ON MAY 15, THEY KIDNAPPED "THE BOSS" IN ORDER TO GET FROM HIM THE NAMES OF HIS OPERATIVES INVOLVED IN THE C.I.A. FIGHT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME.
THIS WAY, THEY WERE CONVINCED THEY COULD STAY IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION AND BECOME EVEN MORE POWERFUL.

YOUR MISSION IS TO LIBERATE "THE BOSS" AND TO BRING HIM BACK SAFELY.

YOU'RE GONNA BE DROPPED FROM THE CHOPPER WITH YOUR PANTHER AT THE SPOT WHERE "THE BOSS" WAS LAST SEEN.
YOU HAVE YOUR 357 MAGNUM READY AND THE PANTHER IS TRAINED TO PROTECT YOU CLOSELY.

YOU'LL HAVE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY, IN SEARCH OF THE HOSTAGE, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR STREET FIGHTING SKILLS WILL PROVE TO BE VERY USEFUL.

IN EACH PART OF THE CITY, YOU WILL CONFRONT VARIOUS ENEMIES AND THEIR GANG LEADERS.
THEY WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE SKILLED IN COMBAT AS YOU PROGRESS. SOME OF THEM ARE SO POWERFUL THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO SAVE BULLETS FOR THESE PARTICULAR FIGHTS.
ONCE YOU REACH THE POINT WHERE "THE BOSS" IS HELD PRISONER, YOU MUST RESCUE HIM AND SAFELY ESCORT HIM BACK TO A SAFE PLACE.

ON THE WAY BACK, YOU WILL HAVE TO BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL, SINCE YOU WILL HAVE TO PROTECT "THE BOSS" WHOSE PHYSICAL CONDITION HAS BEEN WORN OUT.

WILD STREETS IS A SIDE-SCROLLING ARCADE GAME, IN WHICH YOU FIGHT ENEMIES USING PUNCHES, KICKS, YOUR GUN AND SOMETIMES YOUR PANTHER WILL HELP YOU.</desc>

	<desc>BUILDING ON THE BASIC GAMEPLAY AND VISUAL IDEAS OF ULTIMATE'S ATIC ATAC, WIZARD'S LAIR STARS EXPLORER POTHOLE PETE, WHO IS STUCK IN THE LAIR UNLESS HE CAN FIND ALL FOUR PIECES OF THE GOLDEN LION. THE GAME IS VIEWED SLIGHTLY TOP-DOWN, WITH INDOOR ROOMS BORDERED BY LINE DRAWN VECTORS RATHER THAN THE FULLER JUNGLE GRAPHICS.

THE PACE OF THE GAME IS QUITE FAST, AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE ACTION ELEMENTS IS INCREASED BY NOT HAVING INFINITE WEAPONRY. THE ROUTE THROUGH THE GAME IS NON-LINEAR, WITH MULTIPLE EXITS AND SECRET ROOMS COMMONPLACE. ALTHOUGH THE SCREENS ALWAYS CONTAIN A PARTICULAR AREA, RATHER THAN THE SECTIONS OF DIFFERENT AREAS VIEWED IN ATIC ATAC (WHICH MEANT THAT YOU'D OFTEN HAVE TO WORK OUT HOW TO REACH SOME SECTIONS VIA OTHER SCREENS), A RIVER IS A CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE LAYOUT, AND DELIMITS SOME SECTIONS OF THE SCREENS.</desc>

	<name>WIZBALL</name>
	<desc>IN WIZBALL THE PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF THE FRIENDLY WIZARD WIZ WHO CAN TURN HIMSELF INTO A GREEN BALL THAT IS ABLE TO DEFEND HIS WORLD AGAINST THE COLOR-SUCKING ENEMIES WHO HAVE TURNED HIS ONCE BRIGHTLY COLORED WIZWORLD INTO A DRAB PLANET. WITH HIS TRUSTY FELINE COMPANION CATELITE, THE WIZARD WILL RESTORE THE COLORS TO THE WORLD BY RETRIEVING THEM FROM DEFEATED ENEMIES.

THE PLAYER STARTS OUT AS A BOUNCING GREEN BALL THAT CAN SHOOT AND BE PUT INTO MORE OR LESS HEAVY ROTATION TO MOVE SLOWLY OR FASTER, PHYSICALLY CORRECT THROUGH THE SIDE-SCROLLING LEVELS. THE FIRST TASK IS TO UPGRADE THE BALL BY SHOOTING THE FIRST NON-MOVING ENEMIES, AND COLLECT THE GREEN BUBBLES THAT ARE LEFT BY THEM. IN ORDER TO STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE FOLLOWING MOVING ENEMY WAVES, SOME UPGRADES ARE A MUST. FIRST AND FOREMOST, COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE BALL SHOULD BE ACTIVATED (I.E. FLYING THROUGH THE LEVELS), A SHIELD SHELTERING THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE PLAYER'S SHOULD BE ACQUIRED, AND TWO-WAY FIRE (LEFT/RIGHT) SHOULD BE OBTAINED.

BUT THE EXTRA NEEDED TO ADVANCE IN WIZBALL IS YOUR FRIEND CATELITE WHO WILL, ONCE SUMMONED, TAKE THE FORM OF A SMALL GREEN SATELLITE THAT WILL IMITATE THE BALL'S MOVEMENT, OR CAN BE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY THE PLAYER. BESIDES UPPING WIZ' FIRE POWER, CATELITE IS ABLE TO COLLECT PAINT DROPS LEFT BY A CERTAIN KIND OF DEFEATED ENEMIES UNTIL THE RESPECTIVE COLOR POT IS FILLED UP. THERE'S THREE COLORS AVAILABLE (RED, GREEN AND BLUE), AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THEM MUST BE COLLECTED TO COMPLETE A LEVEL AND RESTORE IT TO FORMER COLORFULNESS. EVERY COLOR COMBINATION COLLECTED WILL SEND WIZ TO A BONUS STAGE, THEN TO HIS LABORATORY WHERE ONE OF THE POWER-UPS CAN BE MADE PERMANENTLY.

THE GAME ALSO FEATURES A BUNCH OF MULTI-PLAYER MODES, THERE'S EVEN A TWO-PLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE AMONGST THEM.</desc>

	<desc>JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GREAT WITH TOM-TOM AND HIS GIRLFRIEND TANYA, SOME THUG OF A WOODLAND KING HAD TO KIDNAP HER AND HIDE HER AWAY, AND TOM-TOM DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHERE. THAT'S WHY HE HAS TO EXPLORE DEEP DARK FORESTS, CROSS ENDLESS OCEANS, CLIMB TREACHEROUS SLOPES, SURVIVE ENDLESS VOLCANOES, AND EVEN WALK THROUGH CLOUDS. BUT TOM-TOM WILL NEVER BE TOTALLY ALONE. YOU SEE, WHEN HE GOES THROUGH THE EXOTIC LOCATIONS, HE HAS TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH ITS INHABITANTS, LIKE BEES, SPIDERS, SNAKES, COAL-KIDS, FROGS, BATS, SNAILS, COYOTES, AND OCTOPUSES, TO NAME A FEW. THE HATCHET IS TOM-TOM'S ONLY LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THESE MENACES.

THERE ARE TEN AREAS, EACH CONTAINING FOUR ROUNDS EACH, BUT THE TENTH AREA CAN'T BE ACCESSED UNLESS TOM-TOM COLLECTS ALL THE DOLLS DURING HIS RESCUE MISSION. DURING HIS JOURNEY, HE CAN BREAK OPEN DIFFERENT EGGS THAT WILL REVEAL HATCHETS, SKATEBOARDS, MUSHROOMS, MILK, AND EVEN GUARDIAN ANGELS. YOU CAN RIDE THE SKATEBOARD THROUGH EACH ROUND, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T COLLIDE WITH AN INHABITANT. WHEN YOU COMPLETE EACH ROUND WHILE STILL RIDING THE SKATEBOARD, YOU'LL START THE NEXT ROUND STILL RIDING IT. AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH EACH ROUND, YOUR VITALITY WILL START TO GET LOW, BUT IT CAN BE INCREASED BY GETTING MILK, MUSHROOMS, POTATO CHIPS,OR FRUIT THAT APPEAR EVERYWHERE YOU GO. AS WELL AS THE NORMAL EGGS, THERE ARE ALSO SPECKLED EGGS THAT MUST BE AVOIDED, OTHERWISE THE GOD OF DEATH WILL BE RELEASED, AND ONCE HE FOLLOWS YOU, YOU'LL LOSE VITALITY MUCH QUICKLY. AT THE END OF EVERY FOURTH ROUND, THERE IS A KING WAITING TO DESTROY YOU WITH HIS FIREBALLS OR LIGHTNING BOLTS.

THERE ARE ALSO WARP-GATES, BUT YOU DON'T FIND THEM, THEY FIND YOU. YOU SEE, WARP-GATES APPEAR IN ROUNDS 1-4 OF EACH AREA. IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET ONE FRUIT, A SPECIAL ITEM WILL APPEAR. THESE SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDE HANDBAGS, WRIST WATCHES, A PAIR OF SHOES, A TEDDY BEAR, AND A BOTTLE OF PERFUME. ANOTHER GIRL WILL APPEAR AND TAKE YOU UP TO THE CLOUDS WHERE THE OBJECT IS TO COLLECT AS MANY HEARTS AS YOU CAN WITHOUT FALLING DOWN OR GETTING THE ITEM AGAIN. ONCE YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE HEARTS, YOU CAN GET THE ITEM TO RETURN TO THE SURFACE, AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, YOU'LL GET FURTHER IN THE ROUND.</desc>

	<name>XENON</name>
	<desc>XENON IS THE OBSCURE AND MYSTERIOUS PREDECESSOR TO THE MUCH BETTER KNOWN XENON 2: MEGABLAST. THE GAME IS ACTUALLY NOTHING LIKE ITS SEQUEL, WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTROL SCHEME AND GAMEPLAY. THE PLOT OVERLAPS HOWEVER, WITH THE XENITES MAKING THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE GALAXY.

XENON IS ESSENTIALLY AN OVERHEAD SHOOTER, WHERE THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE SHIP AND MOVES AROUND THE SCREEN. HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN XENON AND ITS SEQUEL IS THAT HERE THE PLAYER ACTUALLY CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLAYFIELD (UP OR DOWN) BY SIMPLY MOVING THE SHIP IN THE DIRECTION OF CHOICE. TO DO THIS IN THE SEQUEL, PLAYERS NEED TO SLAM YOUR SHIP AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND PULL BACK ON THE STICK IN ORDER TO REVERSE-SCROLL THE PLAYFIELD.

IT ALSO FEATURES A 3D PLAYFIELD (SOME ENEMIES, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL BE MOUNTED ON HILLS OF SORT, WHERE PLAYERS CAN'T SHOOT THEM). TO COMBAT THESE THE PLAYER CAN TRANSFORM ITS TANK INTO A PLANE. THE GAME THEN SWITCHES TO THE MORE FAMILIAR GAMEPLAY STYLE AS SEEN IN OTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOTERS. THE PLANE HAS TO TRANSFORM BACK INTO A TANK AGAIN TO COMBAT MOST GROUND UNITS.

IN XENON, UPGRADES ARE TAKEN FROM DESTROYED ENEMIES.</desc>

WITH THIS PLANE WE CAN FIGHT THE DEADLY DOMOGRAM ROVERS; THE TOROID PATROL FLEETS AND THE ZOSHI DEATH SQUADS. 

XEVIOUS IS A VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOTER BASED ON THE 1982 COIN-OP OF THE SAME NAME. IT WAS INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT WAS THE FIRST VERTICALLY SCROLLING SHOOTER TO FEATURE DUAL-LEVEL ATTACKS; BOTH GROUND AND AIR.</desc>

THE GAME HAS 3 STAGES, FIRST TAKING YOU THROUGH ASTEROID CITY, WHICH IS HEAVILY PROTECTED BY AIRCRAFT, GUNS AND MISSILES. MANY BARRIERS ARE ALARMED, LEAVING YOU WITH LIMITED SPACE TO PROGRESS THROUGH, AND FIRE MUST CONSTANTLY BE DODGED.

STAGE TWO IS A SPACE SHOOT OUT AGAINST HORDES OF ENEMY AIRCRAFT - THOSE YOU FAILED TO DESTROY IN THE FIRST PART OF THE TASK. COMPLETE THIS AND YOU REACH THE FINAL BATTLE WITH ZAXXON, WITH THE GAME LOOPING WITH INCREASED DIFFICULTY IF YOU CAN SURVIVE THE FIRST TIME. THERE ARE 3 DISTINCT SKILL LEVELS, WHILE CONTROLS INVOLVE USING FORWARD TO DIVE AND BACK TO CLIMB, IN THE MANNER OF FLIGHT SIMULATION.</desc>
